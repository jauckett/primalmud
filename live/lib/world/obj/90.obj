| ************************************************************* |
| * The Gods seek a champion! It is required that the said    * |
| * champion answer the following questions and riddles with  * |
| * accuracy above that of everyone else. A prize of great    * |
| * power and rarity will be the gift awarded by the Gods.    * |
| ************************************************************* |
|                                                   		|
| 1)                                               		|
|   To become president of the United States you meet five      |
|   requirements, these are four of them		        |
|   - Must be at least 35 years old.                	        |
|   - Must be a citizen of the United States.       	        |
|   - Must have lived in the US for 14 years.       	        |
|   - Must have been born in the US.                		|
|   What is the final requirement?                  		|
|						    		|
| 2)						    		|
|   Jeff and Tony were both playing Chess each of them won 7    |
|   of the seven games they played there were no draws or       |
|   stalemates. How can this be?				|
| 3)						    		|
|    If, two hours ago it was as long after one o'clock in the  |
|    afternoon as it was before once o'clock in the morning,    |
|    what time would it be now?                                 |
|	               					        |
| 4)						    		|
|   The Elf Tree has been known to double in height each year   |
|   for the past ten years. How many years did it take for the  |
|   tree to reach half its current height?			|
|						    		|
| 5)								|    
|   It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,   			|    
|   Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.				|
|   It lies beneath stars and under hills,			|
|   And empty holes it fills.					|
|   It comes first and follows after,				|
|   Ends life, kills laughter.					|
|								|
| 6)								|
|   How many cubic meters of dirt are in a hole 6 metres long,  |
|   2 metres wide, and one meter deep?				|   
|   								|
| 7)								|
|   Before Mt Everest was discovered what was the highest      	|
|   mountain on Earth?						|
|								|
| 8)								|
|   In Darask, if you drop a steel ball weighing 5 pounds from  |
|   a height of 45" will is fall more rapidly through water at  |
|   20 degrees fahrenheit or water at 40 degrees fahrenheit?    |
|								|
| 9)								|
|   This thing all things devours:				|       
|   Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;				|
|   Gnaws iron, bites steel;					|
|   Grinds hard stones to meal;					|
|   Slays king, ruins town,					|
|   And beats high mountains down.				|
|								|
| 10)								|
|   When asked how old he was Robohelp replied, "In two years I |
|   will be twice as old as I was 5 years ago." How old is he?  |
|								|	
| "Please mudmail your answers to Pkunk by the 18th of August"  |
| "at 9pm local time, Answers will be posted the following   "  |
| "day. Good luck, and Good thinking...			     "  |
