........... B O W R A I N B O W R A I N B O W R A I N .............
~
E
word~
There is a single word printed in tiny lettering around the edges of the eyes on
the back of the tail of the peacock strutting in the menagerie in the golden palace
in the centre of the City in a Bottle, which reads...............
Hmmm, you'll have to look closer.
~
E
lettering~
Engraved around the edges of the eyes on the tail of the peacock in the menagerie
in the sultan's palace, in the centre of the City in a Bottle is on repeated word.
~
E
tail eyes~
The eyes on the peacock's tail are hypnotic, seeming to shift randomly between
iridescent blue and green coloration. Gazing deeply at them you think you can
see tiny white lettering around the edges. Or is that just a trick of the light?
~
E
lion peacock~
The lion begins stalking the peacock as you watch. The peacock backs away, then
triumphantly unfurls his glorious tail. On the tail are two huge blue and
green eyes. The lion starts, then turns tail and runs away whimpering.

E

The camels are tethered just outside the city gates, carefully watched by their

a mad dash for safety, but gets lazy and goes back to chewing his cud.

they are well armed, and the way they move suggests they know how to use their

The streets are crowded with hundreds of people, almost all dressed in white,
to reduce the effect of the burning sun. Wandering among them, are black robed
figures, that move with a deadly grace. The crowds unconciously move to avoid

minaret minarets~
From the minarets comes a strange ullulating cry, priests calling the prayer
times to the populace of the city.
~
E
greenery~
The plants in the menagerie are obviously not native to the city, given the
climate. All sorts of tropical plants thrive in the carefully controlled
environment, including spreading ferns and moss.
"Water being wasted so conspicuously that it shocks you to an inner stillness."
			-- Frank Herbert, "Dune"
~
E
menagerie private~
The greenery of the menagerie is almost shocking in contrast to the blowing
sand and aridity of the rest of the city. A peacock spreads his tail, showing
incredible, iridescent colours. In another part of the garden a lion prowls
restlessly, flicking his tail irritably and shaking his flowing, golden mane.
~
E
palace golden huge~
Dozens of tiny minarets surround the huge dome of the palace, each capped
in dully gleaming gold. Joining the minarets is a wall of shining white
stone, totally enclosing the palace grounds. Fierce guards pace the walls,
and far within you can see the lush greenery of the Sultan's private
menagerie.
~
E
city bottle~
A tiny Arabian city is somehow contained within this bottle. In the streets,
thousands of tiny, beturbaned people go about their daily business.
A huge golden palace gleams like fire in the very centre, surrounded by
guards clothed in flowing robes of the purest white. Camels graze near the 
city gates, and children play with balls in the back alleyways. None of 
them notice you looking at them. How astounding.
