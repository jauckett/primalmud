the zombie~
A dead looking zombie is here.

This thing looks like it'd been dead awhile before it was woken from its
peaceful rest by some inconsiderate prankster.

Santa Claus is standing here. He looks alittle unstable.

Carolyn~
Carolyn the Caroller is here. Carolling merrily.
~
She loooks far too jolly for her own good. If she had any more 
Christmas spirit in her she'd probably explode. You find yourself
wishing she would explode... yet you still want to follow her and
join in!
