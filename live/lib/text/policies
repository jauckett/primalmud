                             ------------------

DISCLAIMER
**********
By connecting to this Multi User Dimension you agree to abide by all rules
stated in the login banner, and other text based info within the game.


PrimalMUD is a game that is meant to be fun for all players.  
There are certain rules which you have to follow and abide to
them throughout the game. If you do not wish to follow the rules 
written here, you can type quitr now. 

Read these carefully. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse.

You are fully responsible for everything you do on the mud. If you are faced
with a situation you can't solve, approach other mortals first to see what is
the best way to solve it. You may resort to the gods, but only at last resort.

1. Player-Killing in Designated zones only - type area to find the pk-zones.
   Absolutely NO P.K'ing of Players under Level 15. No Excuses
   Multiple hiring of Assassins for the same victim will be classified as 
   Player killing and will not be tolerated. No summonsing of players OR
   making players follow you to an aggressive mob and leave them there to die.
   No attacking linkless players. If you succesfully PK within the bounds 
   of the rules then you must return their corpse to the tavern.
	PUNISHMENTS - 1st offence - reduction of 1 level
	              2nd offence - reduction of 5 levels
                      3rd offence - reduction of 10 levels & removal of quest eq
		      4th offence - Deletion of character

2. It is not illegal to slay a character who is infected by werewolf or vampire.
   No level restrictions apply. If you do successfully slay a player, you must 
   return their corpse to the tavern. Failure to return corpse to tavern will 
   result in the removal of slaying equipment

3. When assisting another player to level it is illegal to summons the high mobs
   into Haven.  If you want to help a friend level take them to another zone
   where the newbies won't run  across the harder mobs. Do not summons mobs
   for people who want to level quickly, tell the player where the mobs are or
   even take them to the mobs and assist by healing them while playing.

4. Clan members are not allowed to approach players about clans, either to entice
   or threaten them. Players must approach the clan to either join or ask about.
   No messages are to be left on the non-clan boards or clan advertising on
   channels.
	PUNISHMENTS - 1st offence - bannished from clan for 1 week. 
		      2nd offence - bannished from clan for 2 weeks.
		      3rd offence - tba  

5. NO Corpse-Looting.
	PUNISHMENTS - 1st offence - removal of all eq and gold gained by deed.
		      2nd offence - removal of all eq and gold regardless &
				 thief flag set
		      3rd offence - removal of all eq and gold, thief flag &
				 demoted 10 levels

6. NO Player-Stealing. 
	PUNISHMETNS - THE SAME AS NO 5.

7. NO using rude, sexist, homophobic or abusive languages. We do not allow 
   sexual or racial or other harassment of any kind. You will be warned if 
   too many complains are logged against you. Repeating of such actions will 
   be dealt with accordingly.
	PUNISHMENTS - 1st offence - Muted for 1 week
		      2nd offence - Muted for 2 weeks
		      3rd offence - Frozen for One month

8. NO Kill-Stealing. This varies under circumstances.

9. We do not allow exploitation of unknown bugs. If you find a bug, report it
   and do not exploit it for your own gain. If no immortals  are on line, 
   use the 'BUG' command, leave a message on the board or mudmail any of the 
   IMPLEMENTORS. If your are not sure, use common sense. Example : 'energy drain' 
   is giving me 1000 hp, this is a bug, not a feature.
	PUNISHMENTS - Offense - Stripped of all gains by exploiting the bug

10 Do not advertise other games or MUDS on PrimalMUD. doing so will result
   in freezing or instant deletion this will depend on the Immortals
   descretion.

11 Do not attempt to crash the mud. Attempts to crash this mud will result in
   a permanent site ban. If we even SUSPECT you of crashing the mud we will
   ban you.

12 The immortal staff of PrimalMUD work, they deserve respect. Do not use
   public channels to voice a negative opion about an immortal. If any
   mortals have a problem with a an immortals behaviour then approach
   another immortal.
	PUNISHMENTS - 1st Offence - Warning from the gods
		      2nd Offence - Frozen for 1 day
		      3rd Offence - Frozen for 1 week
		      4th Offence (If you are that stupid) - Deleted   

PUNISHMENT inflicted by the gods is highly effective and rarely pretty. If
you have sufficiently enraged the gods to punish you themselves, you probably
can't get back on the game to read this POLICY.


Thank you for taking the time to read this, and enjoy your stay!
