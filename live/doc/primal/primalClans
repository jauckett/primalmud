These ideas are based on a discussion between blackout and dangermouse. _Most_
credit on the ideas should probably be directed towards blackout although I
have heard rumors that the ideas may be based off pleth? and amarok also claims
credit to some of them???.

As the header says it is a proposal and is not complete. Some what may be values
which are undetermined are represented by "X". I would like others to 
make comments in this file where appropiate by the following the annotation 
standard (sorry for the abuse of your pathetic name tali:) :
>> (tali) How about adding feature that includes creation of banannas?
or
>> (tali) This value is to high, make it 5.
or
>> (tali) No this is a bad idea, a better one would be to make the healers heal 
>> only oranges and not apples. 

I simply would like comments to be documented (for better organisation).

This file is stored in the repository under the directory:
newprimal/docs/primalClans 

If you make additions to it and dont add it to the repository, please email it
to me at the address given in the header (IN TEXT FORMAT!).

The idea behind this proposed system is to make clan playing more fun,
addictive and competitive leading to a not so boring clan system - something
with more functionality and entertainment. Additionally the system should be
made such that it is not limited (in the sense that there is always something
that can be added, upgraded etc.)

Clan system:
============

Each clan has the following attributes:
- clan fund (gold - a value based on a ratio of 100:1 of normal coin value)
- clan exp  (exp - a value based on a ratio of 100:1 of normal exp value)
- total clan exp gained (summ of all exp which determines the clan level??)
- gold tax rate (a value representing a percentage from 1 to 50)
- exp tax rate (a value representing a percentage from 1 to 50)

Note: The ratio have been decided to allow values that will not break the
      limits imposed on the size of an unsigned long int (2^32 ~ 4.3 bill).
      eg. clan exp and clan fund can then have max values of 430 bill when
      applying the ratios. 

Derived Attributes:
- clan level - based on the total clan exp gained

	I was thinking of having a list including attributes such as:
		- active (whether they are still in the clan,
			if they rejoin then a new list entry should
			be created so you have a record of when they
			where actually in and out of the clan)
		- date joined (the date they first joined)
		- date left (the date they left)
		- IDNUM (reference to the player id number)
	From this list you can determine all sorts of stats and have
	a complete record of who was/is in the clan and when, as well
	as reference to player idnums for processing player attributes.

- average clan member level
- numb clan members
 

Clan members attribute to these funds by a means of the leader setting taxes.

Example: Clan leader sets gold tax rate at a value between 1 and 50, similarly
for the exp tax rate. 

When a player makes a kill they are automatically taxed the percentage set by 
the clan leader. 

Example: clan gold tax rate set at 10% and clan exp rate set at 10%. A player
makes a kill and gets 100000 exp, they then get 10000 coins from the corpse.

They are deducted: 
a). The clan exp tax rate so 10000 goes towards the clan - apply ratio meaning
    the clan gets 100 exp. If the value, or remainder is less than the ratio, 
    then the player receives that proportion. 
b). To balance the benefits of being a member of a clan, the player is deducted
    additionally a tax of X%.
c). 1000 coins goes towards the clan fund - after applying the ratio means the
    clan gets 10 coins.

A basic or new clan setup involves 1 clan room, and a guard. The clan then
adds and ugrades their features as described in Clan Benefits.

It should also be noted that clan halls do not have to be based in the current
clan area and clan entry points should be pk so clan members can assist guards.

Clan Benefits: (Other ideas would be nice as well)
==============

Clans have the option of buying "features" and upgrading existing features with
the exp and gold available from the tax system. For the simplicity of upgrading
features, I propsed we had a set of determined values for upgrades with a price
that relates to the benefit. Restrictions on features and upgrades can be 
based on the clan level, exp and gold.

Such features include:

Guards:
-------
Each clan has a guard. The guard can be upgraded to improve its stats and
spells (to make it stronger). So a basic clan guard would be able to be killed
making it possible to "hall the gates" of the clan area. 

On attacked guards, a message would be sent across the clan channel letting the
clan know their guard is under attack (not by whom?), and again a message would 
be sent if the guard was killed exposing the clan area. A guard would
be reborn every 3 tics?

Maybe make it to have X reserve guards who replace killed guards immediately,
or come out and assist guards when they are fighting? 

Healers:
--------
Like they are now - except they start off with more basic skills and are 
upgraded to perform higher level spells. Additionally make the frequency of
healing dependent on the ability of the healer. 

Also may want to do something with the classes here - ie. have healers of 
class x that only heal members of class x or something? Races?

Boards:
-------
As many as they like. Make messages removeable by clan leaders, make it so
only members of clan x can write/read the board - probably best as an upgrade!

Rooms:
------
As many as they like. One room may be used as a clan donation room (by clan
donate command). Items and features can be bought for each room including:
fountains, postmen, atms, portals room flags (clan leader/subleader, regenX2)

A clan recall command should also be implemented which may cost clan exp or
gold.

Clan Equipment:
---------------
Each clan has a piece of clan eq. It starts off with basic stats and is 
upgraded. This piece of eq is available to all members of the clan at a flat 
rate cost which is drawn from the clan fund (clan leader should probably have 
to purchase it). May want to add an eq position, or just make a position
sacraficable due to the benefit of the item.

Might also want/have to somehow restrict the stats based on a ratio dependent 
on the clan members level? Blackout didnt really want to restrict it.

Channel:
--------
Not available as default - may want to include enhancements to the channel as
available upgrades.

Include a clan leader channel for negotiations and the likes.


Clan Relations:
===============

Each clan has a relation with every other clan. The relations involve the 
following levels:
war - hostile - neutral - friendly - allies
 
The relations are primarly set by the clan leaders, but would be automatically
adjusted on some scale due to the following events:
- attacking clan guards
- attacking different clan members

Trading: (available to clans was going to be with a relation of neutral plus,
--------  but can make it all such that one clan may "cease fire" if a trade
          is made) 
Clans may trade exp and gold via their leaders. (Gold 1:1 trade, exp 3:2 or
something like that).


Requirements for a new clan:
============================ 

- minimum of 4 members - one over level 60 to act as leader
- creation date of all (at least 4 members) must be at least 2 months old
- total hours played by members must exceed X hours
- descriptions must be supplied for guard and room
- approval from immortals

- anything else to satisfy the validity of a setup 


From here
=========
a). Once a satisfactory amount of feedback is obtained, a decision will be
made whether we:
 1). Leave clan system as is
 2). Remove clan system altogether
 3). Implement this system with changes (minor/major)
 4). Implement another clan system 

if we decide on 3 or 4:

b). The missing details on the system will be filled in and this document will
be redistrubuted. 

c). A proposal will then be posted on primal with the details of the new system
and player feedback will be considered.
 
d). The hard part: Getting the balance? We are going to have to come up with
the upgrade and new feature attributes, values, restrictions as well as the
other things that contribute to the balance. Maybe it wont be that bad - its
generally something I just dread and dont enjoy as much (hint - if someone
wants to work with the actual balance system - values, restrictions, attributes
and everything else, it would be appreciated as I guess I've got some coding
to do if we decide to go this way).

********************************************************************************
[Idea for new base:- Clan Department] Although clans apparently aren't the
highest priority of the new base, here's an idea I had on the subject..  
Firstly, have the corpses of clan members leave behind a head, for instance,
'Head of Jedi Member', 'Head of Jedi Knight', 'Head of Jedi Leader', and
perhaps make these wearable on head for comic effect :o)..  
Then, give clan leaders the ability to weave these heads into 'Clan Eq', which
would differ in power depending on the rank (and level?) of the captued head..
For instance, the clan leader could 'weave head x', where x is the desired wear
bit. (Numeric w/help or name would do fine).. Maybe add an option of gold too..
So the head could be woven into gold..  
Furthermore, if a player not in the clan for which the eq is woven tries to  
the eq, perhaps it could stun them, or damage them.. Who knows..  
Of course, this could be abused, obviously.. F/e clan members doing trades and
so forth, arranged deaths etc.. So perhaps add something into the polcy, and if
players get caught doing wrong to get 'free' eq, demote them 5 levels, banish
them from the clan & take all their clan eq perhaps.. :o)  
Regards,  
Arty.
