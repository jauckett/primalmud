PrimalMUD

Started in July 1994, it has been going strong ever since. Maintained by highly skilled coders and builders, it has been kept in good shaped through the years, expanded upon and upgraded to give players the best imaginable mudding experience.

Primal has 3 sections - Medieval (largest), Future, and Western worlds. Essentially the MUD is medieval, but there are bits to cater for all niches (MTG, Star Wars, Babylon5, etc) More often than not Primal ends up being your ONLY MUD, with other characters, elsewhere, abandonned.
