will be seen hanging around the immortals clubhouse, when they<br>
decide to grace us with their presence. Bickering amongst themselves on who
can&nbsp;<br>
help the new players the most and what IS the best equipment for the new<br>
players!&nbsp; The occasional prayer to them would assist you in receiving<br>
help from them and they should be treated with respect and awe at&nbsp;<br>
all times.&nbsp; Attempts to steal or bicker with them is punishable<br>
by immediate death from them.
