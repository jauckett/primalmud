<p align="left"><img border="0" src="../letters/L.gif" width="50" height="50">ong ago when the tyranny of The Avengers reigned supreme over the land, it was
a dark and evil place. Moe, the leader of The Avengers was a cruel tyrant, feared by all the newbies. For when he would become bored, this terrible king
would take up arms, and lay waste to new players everywhere. Thus he was dubbed The Butcher.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="../letters/T.gif" width="50" height="50">here also existed two smaller clans. The Primal Knights, and The Astral
Wraiths. They both suffered under the curse of Moe, until one day, they could bear it no more. Being too small to fight the Avengers individually, they&nbsp;<br>
united to form a tough but short lived clan called The Astral Knights, but due to the lies and deception of Moe, our numbers slowly dwindled into a handful of
loyal members. Not to be discouraged, we took our small army, and passed ourselves off as clanless fighters, so The Evil One would not watch us.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="../letters/F.gif" width="50" height="50">inally the day came. We threw off our masks of clanlessness, and rose once more
as The Guardians of Justice! Since then, we have remained one of the two major clans of the mud, and a force to be reckoned with. A while after the clan was
formed, Raistlin was reincarnated as the god Moridin. He is no longer a clan&nbsp;<br>
leader, but supports us in spirit, and we pay our respects to him.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><br>
<img border="0" src="../letters/T.gif" width="50" height="50">he current leaders of the clan are Dracion, Roj, and Tarn. If you are a
Guardian, and have been attacked by an opposing clan, these are the people you should speak to. Essentially, The Guardians of Justice are the watchdogs of the
mud, and will defend the innocent and helpless against Moe's army of darkness. All you need do is call, and a Guardian will help.<br>
