out the East Gate can be fraught with it's own perils. Many have died whilst
venturing around in this&nbsp; nomad land past the safety of Haven.</p>

<i>Creator - Cassandra</i><BR>(Levels 1 - 10)<BR>
<B>Location - Head out the East gate towards the Graveyard, and you are there.</B>
<P align="center">
<B><u>The Zone</u></B>
<BR>This is the area to test your skills at low levels, You can take on a warrior 
<BR>from days gone by or hunt some wild boar.  There is a T Junction at the end 
<BR>that leads North and South check it out, you never know what you might find.<P align="center">

<B><U>Special Features</U></B>
<BR>1.  Vampires - The Count hangs around out here on full moons so beware of him.
<BR>You might not want to be a vampire so don't attack him.<BR>

<h3 align="center"><u>Graveyard</u></h3></FONT>
<p align="center">
<i>Creator - Cassandra</i><BR>(Levels 1 - 10)<BR>
<B>Location - Go out the East gate on Regiment Road, through the gate, and keep an <BR>
eye out for a dirt part heading south.</B>
<P align="center">
<B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>You are entering the Graveyard, it seems well kept by the caretaker even 
<BR>though he is hard to find, there are a lot of undead creatures getting around 
<BR>here as well as creepy animals. Definitely one of the best places for a new 
<BR>player to explore, but best done after a few initial levels.  Keep your <BR>
eyes out for a couple of keys in here one will let you into the caretakers house 
<BR>and the other into the Mausoleum.<BR>

<B>Location - From edge of the beach east of Haven off Selva Road leads to the ocean.</B>
<P align="center"><U><B>The Zone</U></B>
</U>
<BR>From the ocean's surface to the depths of the sea, so deep that neither sunlight nor 
<BR>mortal man has every seen. The deeper you venture down towards the black 
<BR>depths of the ocean floor the tougher the adverseries. Stonefish, angler
<BR>fish and sharks hunt for unsuspecting pray while Scylla the horned beast waits to kill the unwary. 
<BR>Undisputed ruler of the sea Poseidon and his vassals oversea the watery depths from his 
<BR>great undersea castle. Not a place for the faint hearted to visit, but a trip 
<BR>under the waters is a unique one and the treasures that can be found could make the 
<BR>perils worthwhile.<BR>

<h3 align="center"><u><font color="#0000FF">Tunnel</font></u></h3>
<p align="center">
<i>Creator - Cassandra</i><BR>(Levels 35 - 45)<BR>
<B>Location - Down Selva road, along the mountain path you will find the Tunnel.</B>
<P align="center"><B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>This is where time has stopped and cavemen still roam, guarding their 
possessions with <BR>caveman might, but defeat them and the rewards 
will prove worth the effort.<font color=blue>

<B>Location - South and east along Selva road and through the Tunnels.</B>
</h3>
<P align="center"><U><B>The Zone</U></B>
</U>
<BR>A seemingly never ending tunnel down into the deeps of the earth, the spiral will 
<BR>leave you wondering which way is left and which is right. A one way trip into the
<BR>earth the zone is populated with trakkers, troglodytes, driders to name but a few. One of 
<BR>the hardest zones for any level, it also contains lots of valuable and useful equipment for 
<BR>higher level players.<BR>

<p align="center">
<i>Creator - Ruprect</i><BR>(Levels 60 - 70)<BR>
<b>Location - Along Selva road, and south into the forest.</B>
<P align="center"><B><u>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>Heroes, villians, wild beasts and gods from ancient myth and legend all can be found in the
<BR>lands of Ancient Greece. From the city of Troy to the Aegean sea and the throne 
<BR>of Zeus, heroes such as Perseus, alongside villains like Medusa and gods like Neptune 
<BR>can all be seen. Look out for Zeus though, he'll throw you into Tarterus to face Pluto and Cerberus 
<BR>if you pester him.

Submerged and hidden in depths beyond most mortal's reach, the Sphere lies <BR>
secluded, pulsing with eerie alien life. Those that controlled<BR>
the ship have long since perished, and only their mechanical aids remain, <BR>
endlessly maintaining their vigil against intruders.
