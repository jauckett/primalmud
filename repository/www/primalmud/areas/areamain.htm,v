<BR>
<img src="../letters/P.gif" width="50" height="50">rimary and largest, <b>Medieval</b> dominates and
tends to be where <BR> the players congregate. It contains upward of <b>35</b>
areas where characters may contend with various <BR>creatures, puzzles
and mazes. Far away, wild and dangerous creatures can be found, untamed
<BR>by man woman or fiend, hoarding vast treasures and magical items
with strange properties.

<img src="../letters/A.gif" width="50" height="50">ccessible via stagecoach is <b>WestWorld</B>.
<BR>Here cowboys still roam the land, gunslinging and raunchy, while Indians
battle for survival.
<BR>
<img src="../letters/L.gif" width="50" height="50">astly, <b>FutureWorld</b> beckons through
a magical portal.<BR>
Here amazing creatures made from metallic substances can be found, and alien
beings<br>from unknown universes wander the streets, equally amazed at
the strangeness of their surroundings.
