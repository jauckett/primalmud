<B>Location - This is where you start out in West World.</B><P>
<U><B>The Zone</B></U>
<BR>You will see the Sheriff around town and his Deputies keeping the peace. <BR>
They are good at it cause they got good training from the Mayor, he can afford 
<BR>to pay for the best men for his town. Check him out if you're game, he is rich!<BR>
<P><B>Shops</B><BR>
There are four shops to visit in Hope.<BR>
<BR>1. The Weapons shop - You can get all the weapons and ammo you need for the wild west here.

<B>Location - West down main street of hope will take you to the saloon.</B><P>
<B><U>The Zone</U></B><BR>
Go in for a drink and listen to the Pianist play some tunes for you, <BR>
he's pretty good.  Watch out if you decide to have a game of poker <BR>
with the boys, they cheat.  If you look around you can find a place to sleep upstairs <BR>
and might even run into the boss, I hear he has put a nice tidy stash <BR>
away somewhere, you just gotta find it.  And then get out without losing it <BR>
to the poker players or the con artist.
<BR><BR><B>Shops</B>
<BR>There is one shop to visit in Saloon.<BR>
<BR>1.  Behind the bar - You can get a drink here and tell your problems to the bartender.

<B>Location - West down main street of hope and just past the saloon</B>
<P><B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>Come on in and fill your hearts desire, Candy comes highly recommended, 
<BR>if the madam will let you see her.  But done push the subject the bouncer here 
<BR>is a bit of a hothead.  Some of these whores must make some money, them and their 
<BR>patrons seem to have a bit on them.  Check it out, You might walk away with 
<BR>a bit more then you expected but it can be cured.<BR>

<A NAME=Fort><FONT COLOR=Blue><H3>Fort Hope</H3></FONT></A>
<i>Creator - TSD</i><BR>(Level 35+)<BR>
<B>Location - Head south from the City of Hope.</B>
<P><B><U>The Zone</u></B>
<BR>This is the main fort defending Hope. 
<BR>The Colonel has his men on ready for action all the time.  In the morning 
<BR>you may hear the trumpet blow waking everyone up.  Go up on the lookout 
<BR>path and you can see for miles, great view. But beware there are also rumours 
<BR>going around that the cells in here are haunted by an old Indian that was killed in them. 
<BR>Feel like a ghost hunt?
