<A name="Camelot"><font color=blue><h3><u>Camelot</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - Backspace</i><BR>(Levels 25 - 40) <BR>
<B>Location - From the 3 of Swords head South on the path through the mountains 
<BR>and then the plains right into Camelot.</B>
<P><B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>This is the Castle run by King Arthur and his knights of the round table. 
<BR>It is well guarded and if you're lucky you might run into some of the
<BR> student guards and pick up a few tricks or even learn to be a knight 
<BR>yourself.  If you look around long enough in here you may come across 
<BR>Merlin the great Magician as well, who has some potions and spells stashed 
<BR>away that are found nowhere else. <BR>

<P>
<hr width=50%>

<a name="Crystal"><font color=blue><h3><u>Crystal Castle</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - Freako</i><BR>(Levels 25 - 40)<BR>
<B>Location - Go across the great sandy Desert to the Oasis then head North <BR>
into the castle.</B>
<P><B><u>The Zone</u></B>
<BR>The Crystal King rules this castle while watching his jesters play <BR>
around. He seems to be unaware of the Dragons that roam in his dungeon, <BR>
which can be a very rewarding place to visit.<BR>

<P>
<hr width=50%>

<A name="Drieland"><font color=blue><h3><u>Drieland Forest</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - Cassandra</I> <BR>(Levels 30 - 40) <BR>
<B>Location - Along Darask road a tree stump marks the way down into the forest.</B>
<P><B><u>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>Within this forest where wolves snarl,
<BR>and Druids protect, evil eyes an island surround,
<BR>but seek ye the centre,
<BR>for there it is that treasures abound. 

<P>
<hr width=50%>

<a name="Ship"><font color=blue><h3><u>Pirate Ship</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i> Creator - John </i><BR>(Levels 30 - 40)<BR>
<B>Location - At the end of Haven's Wharf await for the pirates to dock. </B>
<P><B><u>The Zone</u></B>
<BR>Captained by the wicked Redbeard Rum the ship is full of nasty, drunken <BR>
pirates with all sorts of weapons and their ill begotten loot. This could 
<BR>make you quite a rich adventurer if you play your cards right.<BR>

<P>
<hr width=50%>

<a name="Khulgurs"><font color=blue><h3><u>Khulgur's Lost Empire</u></h3></font></a>
<i>Creator - Calrain </i><BR>(Levels 30 - 40)<BR>
<B>Location - Near Werith's on Darask road, a rocky path leads here.</B>
<P><B><u>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>The Master of the mines controls this zone, while the Dwarves do the 
<BR>mining for him. What are they mining? Could it be GOLD? <BR>

<P>
<hr width=50%>

<a name="Shadow"><font color=blue><h3><u>Shadow Keep</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - Gabe</i><BR>(Levels 30 - 50)<BR>
<B>Location - Through the plains and tall grass lie the doors of Shadow Keep.</B>
<P><U><B>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>This place is strage, with disembodied people walking about, and Shadowen lurking <BR>
around every corner.  The Statue of Vashnaka is quite a work of art.  After 
<BR>all this the rainbow maze awaits, rumoured to protect substantial treasures.<BR>

<P>
<hr width=50%>

<a name="Tunnel"><font color=blue><h3><u>Tunnel</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - Cassandra</i><BR>(Levels 35 - 45)<BR>
<B>Location - Down Selva road, along the mountain path you will find the Tunnel.</B>
<P><B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>This is where time has stopped and cavemen still roam, guarding their 
possessions with <BR>caveman might, but defeat them and the rewards 
will prove worth the effort.

<P>
<hr width=50%>


<a name="MTG"><font color=blue><u><h3>Magic: The Gathering</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creators - Deathblade & Pkunk</i><BR>(Levels 35 - 50)<BR>
<B>Location - Along Gambol road, the path to the temple goes west. <BR>
Find Richard and ask him about Magic.</B>
<P><B><u>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>Richard is the creator of magic and will teach you all about it, this world 
<BR>is a hoarder's paradise, with equipment for every possible person 
<BR>you might imagine.  There are many places to explore.
<P><B><u>Shops</u></B>
<BR>There are two shops to visit in MtG.
<P>1.  The Samite Shrine - The Healer here has potions for all sorts of things, some are quite original.
<BR> 2. A Tiny Library - The old man here must have studied the books alot, the things he sells <BR>
would take a lot of knowledge to make.<BR>

<P>
<hr width=50%>

<A name="Tudor"><font color=blue><h3><u>Tudor</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - John</i><BR>(Levels 35 - 55)<BR>
<B>Location - Through Lhankwood and Rushmoor Swamp the northern gates of Tudor await.</B>
<P><B><u>The Zone</u></B>
<BR>Filled with riches, the city of Tudor is a long way from the safety of Haven.<BR>
Melchid, Queenie and the great braggart warrior Lord Flashard are only a few of <BR>
the many people just waiting for you to relieve them of their wealth.
<P>
<U><B>Shops</U></B>
<BR>There are two shops to visit in Tudor.
<P>1. The Weaponsmith store - Tired of vampires and werewolves? Silver daggers and wooden stakes <BR>
to free the creatures from their diseases are available here.<BR>
2. The Magic shop - Queen's potions and staves are for sale by the old wizard running the shop.<BR>

<P>
<hr width=50%>

<A name="Eliqua"><font color=blue><h3><u>Eliqua River</u></h3></font></a>
<i>Creator - Unknown</i><BR>(Levels 35 - 60) <BR>
<B>Location - Off the jetty in Haven.</B>
<P><b><u>The Zone</u></b>
<BR>Full of reptiles and dangerous creatures that can drain your strength permanantly,
<BR>this area is reputed to hold the invaluable eyes of the Serpent, which allow
<BR>the most powerful spells to be cast.

<P>
<hr width=50%>

<a name="Danger"><font color=blue><h3><u>Danger Island</U></h3></font></a>
<i>Creator - John</i><BR>(Levels 40 - 50)<BR>
<B>Location - Take the Pirate ship from the wharf of Haven to the Island.</B>
<P><B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>Watch your back! This island is filled with murderous pirates, unfriendly 
<BR>natives and bad tempered creatures, who'll all turn on you without provocation. 
<BR>The fights are tough on the island and the danger great, but the satisfaction of 
<BR>recovering the stolen treasures from the pirates make it worth the risk. <BR>

<P>
<hr width=50%>

<a name="Black"><font color=blue><h3><u>Black Tower</u></h3></FONT></a> 
<i>Creator - Cassandra</i><BR>(Levels 30 - 50)<BR>
<B> Location - Through the Drielend forest and then across the lake, scale a cliff and seek the path.</B>
<P><U><B>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>Within the tower on this island roam oozes and demons, all your greatest nightmares.
<BR>This is the place to face and defeat your greatest fears. A fantastic place to explore, with 
<BR>interesting creatures and treasures.
