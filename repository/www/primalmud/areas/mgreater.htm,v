<A name="Holy"><font color=blue><h3><u>Holy City</u></h3></font></a>
<i>Creator - Cassandra </i><BR>(Levels 50 - 70)<BR>
<B>Location - Through the Sandy desert the holy city raises above the hot sands into the clouds.</B>
<P><U><B>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>Leading from the hot sands of the desert and a long abandoned city, a great sphinx leads 
<BR>up into the clouds. Deva's, cockatrices, giant dragonflies and other strange, 
<BR>beautiful and deadly creatures live amongst the clouds, high above the earth.<BR>
A tough and challenging zone, there are rewards for those who are willing to risk their 
<BR>lives climbing ever higher above the ground.

<a name="Spiral"><font color=blue><h3><u>Spiral</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - Cassandra</i><BR>(Levels 50 - 70) <BR>
<B>Location - South and east along Selva road and through the Tunnels.</B>
<P><U><B>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>A seemingly never ending tunnel down into the deeps of the earth, the spiral will 
<BR>leave you wondering which way is left and which is right. A one way trip into the
<BR>earth the zone is populated with trakkers, troglodytes, driders to name but a few. One of 
<BR>the hardest zones for any level, it also contains lots of valuable and useful equipment for 
<BR>higher level players.<BR>

<a name="Moanders"><font color=blue><h3><u>Moander's Domain</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - Drax</i><BR>(Levels 50 - 70)<BR>
<B>Location - Travel to the Sandy Desert near the end of Darask road, through the desert to the Domain.</B>
<P><B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>Filled with demons of fire, pantathian serpent priests and the souls of the damned, the Domain is 
<BR>a place of horror,  and is so vile that no-one can sleep peacefully within it's twisted landscape. Foulest of 
<BR>all the fiends within is the god Moander, a giant rotting pile of filth seeking dominion of the world.<BR>

<P>
<hr width=50%>

<a name="Greece"><font color=blue><h3><u>Ancient Greece</u></h3></font></a>
<i>Creator - Ruprect</i><BR>(Levels 60 - 70)<BR>
<b>Location - Along Selva road, and south into the forest.</B>
<P><B><u>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>Heroes, villians, wild beasts and gods from ancient myth and legend all can be found in the
<BR>lands of Ancient Greece. From the city of Troy to the Aegean sea and the throne 
<BR>of Zeus, heroes such as Perseus, alongside villains like Medusa and gods like Neptune 
<BR>can all be seen. Look out for Zeus though, he'll throw you into Tarterus to face Pluto and Cerberus 
<BR>if you pester him.<BR>

<a name="oddhouse"><font color=blue><h3><u>An Odd House</u></h3></font></a>
<i>Creator - Sandii</i><BR>(Levels 70 - 85)<BR>
<b>Location - West out of Haven, along darask road. Find the rocky path
that leads to Rand's valley. </b>
<P><b><u>The Zone</u></b>
<BR>Strange as the name suggests, this house has been infested with
<BR>plant life that scours the woodwork for things unknown. The careful
<BR>adventurer may survive long enough to discover some truly amazing
<BR>treasures hoarded by the critters.
<BR>

<A name="Forever"><font color=blue><h3><u>The Island Forever</u></h3></font></a>
<i>Creator - Talisman</i><BR>(Levels 75 - 100)<BR>
<b>Location - Undisclosed.</b>
<P><b><u>The Zone</U></b>
<BR>On this magical island the battle for supremacy between Good and Evil is being waged with a fury.
<BR>Holy warriors challenge Evil knights into duels, while struggling to reach the dark <BR>
tower atop a cliff where Arcane Magic is employed to unknown ends.
