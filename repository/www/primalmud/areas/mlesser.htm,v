<B><u>The Zone</B></U>
<BR>Wandering around in here, there are heaps of creatures and equipment, <BR>
and if you like killing ogres this is the place to be. Take a lantern with you, 
<BR>there are some dark places in here and you don't want to get lost.<BR>
<P>
<HR width=50%>

<A NAME="Selva"><FONT COLOR=blue><h3><u>Selva Road</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - Cassandra</i><BR>(Levels 1 - 10)<BR>

<P>
<B><u>The Zone</u></B>
<BR>This is the area to test your skills at low levels, You can take on a warrior 
<BR>from days gone by or hunt some wild boar.  There is a T Junction at the end 
<BR>that leads North and South check it out, you never know what you might find.<P>

<B><U>Special Features</U></B>

<B>Location - Go out the East gate on Regiment Road, through the gate, and keep an <BR>
eye out for a dirt part heading south.</B>
<P>
<B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>You are entering the Graveyard, it seems well kept by the caretaker even 
<BR>though he is hard to find, there are alot of undead creatures getting around 
<BR>here as well as creepy animals. Definitely one of the best places for a new 
<BR>player to explore, but best done after a few initial levels.  Keep your <BR>
eyes out for a couple of keys in here one will let you into the caretakers house 
<BR>and the other into the Mausoleum.<BR>

<P>
<HR width=50%>

<A name="Plains"><FONT COLOR=blue><u><h3>Plains</u></H3></FONT></A>
<i>Creator - John</i><BR>(Levels 5 - 10)<BR>
<B>Location - Follow Market way into Gambol Road, and all the way south from there.</B>
<P>
<B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>The plains are a good place for hunting. There are vultures, wolves and 
<BR>even buffalo for the brave adventurers. You can also go check out the dry 
<BR>creek bed or fumble through the long grass.<BR>

<P>
<HR width=50%>

<A NAME="Mountains"><FONT COLOR=blue><u><h3>Mountains</u></h3></FONT></A>
<i>Creator - John</i><BR>(Levels 5 - 10)<BR>
<B>Location - Haven's West gate leads onto Pomarj road, which joins up with Darask Road winding <BR>through these mountains.</B>
<P><B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>This is the area where sneaking and stealing are strong, there are bandits <BR>
and gypsys ready to take your money every chance they get.  You might even want to<BR>
 hunt a mountain lion while you are up here. <BR>

<P>
<HR width=50%>

<A name="Rome"><font color=blue><u><h3>Rome </u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - Adapted Default</i><BR>(Levels 5 - 100) <BR>
<B>Location - Follow Market Way down through Gambol Road. <BR>
Once there go west through Rome's Gates.</B>
<P><B><u>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>This place is Controlled by the great Caesar from high above Rome<BR>
in the Capitol.  He has built a great city to see, go and watch some Jousting in 
<BR>the Arena and get a hotdog and beer while you are there.  Beware of the <BR>
aqueducts things get a little tough in there.
<BR>At the other end is the fabled Valley of the Gods. 
<P><B><U>Shops</U></B>
<BR>There are four shops  to check out in Rome.<P>
1.  Swords 'R Us - There are a couple of items you won't be able to get in Haven.
<BR>2.  The Mage's shop - In here you can buy staves, wands, scrolls and potions.
<BR>3.  The Roman Bakery - Yum, A bakery the also sells beer, what can I say?
<BR>4.  The General Store - Where else can you get your general supplies from? 

<P>
<HR width=50%>

<A Name="Aqua"><font color=blue><u><h3>Aqua Marina</h3></u></font></A>
<i> Creator - Abulafia </i> <BR>(Levels 5 - 70) <BR>
<B>Location - From edge of the beach east of Haven off Selva Road leads to the ocean.</B>
<P><U><B>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>From the ocean's surface to the depths of the sea, so deep that neither sunlight nor 
<BR>mortal man has every seen. The deeper you venture down towards the black 
<BR>depths of the ocean floor the tougher the adverseries. Stonefish, angler
<BR>fish and sharks hunt for unsuspecting pray while Scylla the horned beast waits to kill the unwary. 
<BR>Undisputed ruler of the sea Poseidon and his vassals oversea the watery depths from his 
<BR>great undersea castle. Not a place for the faint hearted to visit, but a trip 
<BR>under the waters is a unique one and the treasures that can be found could make the 
<BR>perils worthwhile.<BR>

<P>

<A name ="Weriths"><font color=blue><u><h3>Werith's Wayhouse</h3></u></FONT> </A>
<i>Creator - Default</i><BR>(Levels 10 - 20)<BR>

<BR>Welcome to Werith's Wayhouse, here you can get yourself a drink and tell <BR>
the bartender your problems. There are a few regulars that hang around a bit, 
<BR>go in and say 'hello', most of them are pretty friendly folks.<BR>

<P>
<HR width=50%>

<A Name="Darask"><font color=blue><u><h3>Darask</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - Murf</i><BR>(Levels 10 - 20)<BR>
<B>Location - This town lies at the end of Darask Road.</B>
<P><B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>This is a quiet little town where the citizens are poshy and do not <BR>
take to strangers very well.  
<P>
<B><U>Special Features</B></U>
<BR>There is one special feature in this zone.
<P>1.  Assassin's Guild - Here players can hire an Assassin to kill other players 
<BR>for a hefty price. If death is your business, this is your place.<BR>

<A name="Toyheim"><font color=blue><u><h3>Toyheim</h3></u></font></A>
<i>Creator - Drax</i><BR>(Levels 10 - 20)<BR>
<B>Location - The beanstalk in Darask leads the way here.</B>
<P><B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>Toyheim is like a kids toybox. Little energiser bunnies and transformers
<BR>are the citizens of this town. Play with them if you like, but be warned, 
<BR>some of them don't play fair and don't like to lose.
<BR>

<P>
<HR width=50%>

<A Name="Rand"><font color=blue><u><h3>Rand's Tower</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - Default</i><BR>(Levels 10 - 20)<BR>
<B>Location - Along Darask road, find a mountain trail. Search for a clearing, <BR>
and the hidden trapdoor there.</B>
<P>
<B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>This is a place where many people have turned to evil and have come 
<BR>to study Dark Magic. There is a library here and a secret treasure <BR>
if you look hard enough. Evil scholars wander the halls, and dark experiments<BR>
run amoc in some areas, seeking retribution against their makers.<BR>

<P>
<HR width=50%>

<a name="Swords"><font color=blue><u><h3>3 of Swords </u></h3></font></a>
<i>Creator - Default</i><BR>(Levels 10 - 20)<BR>
<B>Location - In the Plains, follow the dry creek to the stony path, and then onward.</B>
<P><U><B>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>In the town, everyone is fairly peaceful, and they dont get alot of 
<BR>visitors stopping in, which is the way they like it. Bandits are holed up
<BR> here somewhere, terrorising the area and it's inhabitants.
<P>
<B><U>Shops</U></b>
<BR>1.  Farmer's Market - There are farmers selling all their produce here, quite cheaply.

<A name="Lhankwood"><font color=blue><u><h3>Lhankwood Forest</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - John</i><BR>(Levels 10 - 25)<BR>
<b>Location - Through the West gate of Haven, and south on Nyrond Road.</B>
<P><B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>A very eerie and dangerous forest, this haunted wood is overlayed with a thick<BR>
canopy that prevents light from penetrating the many paths that meander through it.<BR>
Elves have made their home on the western border, hoping to hold the forest at<BR>
bay, and it's evil denizens under control. 

<P>
<hr width=50%>

<a name="Ershteep"><font color=blue><h3><u>Ershteep Road</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - Gabe</i><BR>(Levels 10 - 25)<BR>
<B>Location - West off Gambol Road, this road meanders west and north. </b>
<P><B><u>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>If you want to pick some fights with Enfans this is the place to be.<BR> 
Follow the road into a town which is overrun by these creatures. Enter<BR>
and seek out some of the deserted shops where you might find the <BR>
something behind when the enfans chased the citizens out of town.<BR>

<P>
<hr width=50%>

<i>Creator - John </i><BR>(Levels 20 - 30)<BR>
<B>Location - Through Lhankwood forest the swamp lies. </B>
<P><B><u>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>A horrible place, with wandering cannibals and rotting body parts lying around,
<BR>old hags and wraiths seek the blood of those who enter. Definitely not 
<BR>a place for the weak.

<P>
<hr width=50%>

<a name="Fairytale"><font color=blue><h3><u>Fairytale Forest</u></h3></FONT></a>
<i>Creator - Ruprect</i><BR>(Levels 20 - 30)<BR>
<B>Location - In Toyheim's treasure room there is a storybook, type 'go book' to enter the fairytale.</B>
<P><B><u>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>Welcome to your childhood fairytales, go in and see everyone, just follow 
<BR>the yellow brick road. Go in and say hi to Willy Wonka and the gang in 
<BR>the chocolate factory, play with the three little pigs, Hansel 
<BR>and Gretel, or even Jack and Jill. They are all lots of fun and there 
<BR>is much to get.
