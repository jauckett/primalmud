<P><BR><B>Medieval</B> is the home of many fabulous creatures and players.<P>

So many areas exist within this world, that they need to be categorised<BR>
into <b>3</b> separate sections. <P>

For newer characters, <A HREF="mlesser.htm" target="areamain"> Lesser Medieval </A> is the place to start.<BR>
Moving up? <A HREF="mmiddle.htm" target="areamain"> Middle Medieval </a> proves a greater challenge.<BR>
Ultimately, <A HREF="mgreater.htm" target="areamain"> Greater Medieval</A> caters to seasoned players.<BR>

<B><U>The Zone</U></B>
<BR>Welcome to Haven, this is the safest area to hang around, it is well protected 
<BR>by the city guards, if you decide to fight here watch out for them, 
<BR>they believe in protecting the innocent.  There are several notice boards up around 
<BR>town, at the top of Main street is the Quest Board, keeping players abreast of 
<BR>all the quest happenings and what equipment may be won. 

<P>East from here is the tavern, where the main social board may be read to keep in touch 
<BR>with what is happening.  While in the Tavern personal mud-mail can be received from the 
<BR>Postmaster there, with the 'receive' command.

<P><B>Shops</B><BR>
There are several shops and places to check out in Haven.
<P>1.  The Donation Room - You would be amazed what people throw away.
<BR>2.  The Armourer - You can buy some pretty good equipment here.
<BR>3.  The Weaponsmith - He will sell you any weapon you want for the right price.
<BR>4.  The General Store - In here you will find all sorts from food to lanterns.
<BR>5.  The Alchemist - Now heres a shop! You can buy potions for all sorts of situations.
<BR>6.  The Magic Shop - The Magician will sell you different scrolls and wands that will 
<BR>help you on your travels.
<BR>7.  The Jeweller - Woohoo, If you find some treasure go see him, he will pay you nicely for it.
<BR>8.  The Guilds - This is where you should go to practice spells and skills, don't worry if you're<BR>
 not the right class, you may train at any of them.
<BR>9.  The Paladin's Temple - Here you can buy hitpoints and mana, even increase your stats 
<BR>if you're rich enough.
<BR>10.   The Tavern - Here you will get your mail, look at the board and after a tough fight it's 
<BR>a good place to rest. (Heal twice as fast!)
<P><B><U>Special Features</U></B><BR>
There are a few special features in this town.<P>
1.  Other Worlds - There are 2 other worlds to visit, if you look around you can find a link to them.
<BR>2.  Vampires & Werewolves - Beware, they only appear on full moons and I wouldn't want<BR>
 to attack one in case you get infected.
<BR>3.  The Autoteller - You can safely deposit your money so you don't lose it.
<BR>4.  The Casino - Where the rich get richer, and the poor have some hope.
