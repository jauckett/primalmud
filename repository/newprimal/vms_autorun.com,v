$! This script is used to run the CircleMUD executable as a detached 
$! process.
$!
$! This ONLY runs the CircleMUD CIRCLE executable, it does NOT do anything 
$! else extra that the Unix "autorun" script does.
$!
$! To have the CIRCLE executable execute under a different UIC, change the
$! variable UIC below.
$!
$! To customize the CIRCLE startup, edit the [.BIN]VMS_CIRCLEMUD.COM file.
$!
$!
$! Define The UIC The CIRCLE.EXE Is To Execute Under.
$!
$ UIC = "SYSTEM"
$!
$! Run [.BIN]VMS_CIRCLEMUD.COM As A Detached Process.
