coat penguin skin~
   A skilled tailor has spent numerous hours patching penguin skins together to
make this fine coat.  It is quite heavy, and should prove a good protective
measure against the cold.  The thought of how many penguins must have died to
make this coat is a little saddening, though.

wolfs skull~
   Someone has gone to the trouble of removing all the flesh and tissue from
this skull.  By it's shape, it is obvious that it has come from some form of
canine, most likely a wolf.  The inside has been hollowed out, and you should
be able to wear it over your head.
