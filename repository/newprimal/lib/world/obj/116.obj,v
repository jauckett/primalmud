&yVery soon customers will start to enter the store, wanting you to serve 
them food. Your job is the call out the orders so that the Burger Flipper
can make the items and put them in the warmers. You then need to collect
the order and have it to the customer in a timely fashion.

&r****************************************&n 
&r*        &YConcert Goers food  &r          *&n 
&r*          &Y     MENU           &r        *&n

&r*                                      *&n 
&r****************************************&n 
&cTo show the menu at any time say "Show Menu"

&YWhen the Burger Flipper has completed your order, he will place it as follows:

&YCheese Burger, Veggie Burger, Beef Nuggets
   &yThese items will be in the Food Warmer
&YChips
   &yThese will be in the Chip Machine
&YCoke
   &yThese will be stacked on the ground
   You will need to fill the coke from the Drink machine.

&YThe following is the list of examples

&YOrder eg. (cheese Burger)&n
say Cheese  please
get cheese Warmer
give cheese Xxxxx

&YOrder eg. (Chips)&n
say Chips  please
get Chips machine
give Chips xxxxx

&YOrder eg. (Coke)&n
say Coke  please
get Coke
fill Coke drink
say "Customers Please"
And your working day will begin.


&yIf you get the order ready and hand it to the customer on time the 
customer will put tokens in the register.

&yOnce a week the owner of "Concert Goers Food" will come to collect the 
tokens from the register. When he collects the tokens you will be rewarded 
for your work. This reward will vary depending on how many orders you serve 
in that time.

&YFor this you will need to:
&yCollect the tokens from the register, hand them to him and ask him to
count them.

&YGive Manager Money eg.&n
get all.token reg
give all,tokens manager
say count please


&yYou also had better be on the look out for a Robber, who from time to time,
will drop in and steal all the money in the register.

&yAfter you have had time to read through this info
say "Customers Please"
And your working day will begin.
