bookshelf book shelf bookshelves shelves~
   OH DEAR ME!  Not a speck of dust lies on any of these shelves.  How on earth
does one get up to clean these floating in mid air.  Or how does the shelves
find the one to clean down there!  Or does it ever need cleaning at all?  
Maybe they clean themselves?  Makes one wonder what shelves get up to these
days.

dresser~
   This dresser is made from fine carved blackwood and has been carefully
shelacked.  Though you wonder why on earth would a dresser be called a dresser.
It doesnt dress anything, nor holds only dresses but any clothing.  It doesnt
even help with dressing, just sits there awkwardly doing nothing.

   Covered in an elaborate tapestry this armchair looks so comfortable.  
Unfortunately you are falling to fast and will miss your opportunity to sit and
rest your bones.

cupboard~
   Now what a strange cupboard indeed!  Painted pink and red, shaped like a star
with a tiny round door located the the very bottom of the left hand star spike.
Certainly it would be hard enough putting anything in, let alone getting the
back out again!  How extremely odd!

cake~
   This small strawberry cake is topped with pink icing and has the very
curious words "eat me" made from carefully positioned currents on top.  
Although considering it looks very delicious indeed, the words "eat me" doesnt
seam necessary.
