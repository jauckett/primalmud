Welcome to &RPrimal Mud&n!

As a newbie, you have been given everything you need to start out.
You should start by typing '&4info&n' and '&4help&n' to familiarize yourself
with how the mud works. Venture around the the town of &1Haven&n and nearby areas.
Before you kill anything, type '&4con <creature name>&n' eg: '&4con citizen&n'
This will give you an indication of how tough your opponent is, and may save
you from becomming someone's dinner.

If you would like some help getting started on your adventure, type:
'&4say help please&n' in this room. Gamina is very friendly, and loves to help
newbies get started out.

If you have any problems, try asking a higher level player for assistance.
We hope you enjoy your time on &RPrimal&n.

Good Luck! (You may need it.)

You should start by typing 'info' and 'help' to familiarize yourself with how the mud works.
then look around the town of haven and surrounding areas.
Before you kill anything, type 'con mobname' where mobname is the name of the creature
e.g 'con citizen'
This will give you an idea of how tough your oponent is, and may save you becoming something's dinner.
If you would like some help getting started on your adventure, say 'help please' in this room.
Gamina is very friendly, and loves to help newbies get started.
