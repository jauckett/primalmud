What! Are you blind! I don't sell that.~
Your about as honest as a Centauri if you expect me to buy something you don't have.~
Find someone else to offload that on you degenerate.~
Maybe I'd buy it if didn't cost as much as a small ship.~
What! Do you think I'm as stupid as you look ? No charity you cheapskate.~
Alright, your robbing me blind, but I'll let you have it for %d.~
Fine. Go spend %d of my money you thief, I'll take it.~

This is a bar! If you want that go elsewhere.~
You've obviously had too much to drink if your trying to sell that.~
I sell drinks, if you want to sell that go elsewhere, buy a drink or get out!~
Maybe I'd buy it - if you weren't trying to ask so much.~
This is a bar, not a charity, if you can't afford anything, your just taking up space.~
Alright you can have it for %d, enjoy.~
Your robbing me blind, but I'll take it for %d.~

Hmmpph! We don't sell THAT sort of thing here.~
If you've drunk so much your trying to sell that, then please leave this establishment.~
We're a restaurant not a second goods store~
Look, I'd like to buy, but I have a family to feed as well.~
We only feed those who can pay, pay up or shut up!~
Ok, %d is a steal, but I'll take it.~
Enjoy! For only %d your getting the finest fair on the station.~
