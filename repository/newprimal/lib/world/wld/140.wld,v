Ages Braveheart zone~
You standing on the hills of Scotland, land streaches as far as the eye can
see.  Vast hills and grassland covers the mountians, peering down the hills
there seems to be a small town ahead.

Scotland Hills~
The grass seems to be long and think, you are getting closer to the town and it
seems to be a peaceful one.  You see a large guard standing outside the towns
gate keeping a close eye on the hills.

Gates of the town~
You slowly walk up to the gate of the town.  There is no sign saying what the
name of the town is or who is welcome here.  Peering past the gates it seems
that most of the people in the town are farmers and peasants.
