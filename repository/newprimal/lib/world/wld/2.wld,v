through the leaves lightly touching your skin.  To the East is Murf Drive and
the Primal Parklands are to your west.

There are houses intermingled amongst the trees many of them actually part of

to laze away in procrastination, surrounded by the lava and fire pits of &rhell&n,
you are all too aware of how much this accomplishes.
