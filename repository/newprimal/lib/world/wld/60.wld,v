A dark rock passageway~
You are floating along a turn in the dark passageway.
On both sides of you dark rocks tower high above you
making you feel closed in and uneasy.

A turn in the dark rock passageway~
You are floating along a rocky passageway that is extremely narrow
To your south is a dark cavern that looks rather dangerous. This place
gives you an uneasy feeling and you feel nervous about going any further

Ocean floor~
You float through the deepest of all depths. This is one of the darkest
places the planet has to offer. Neither sunshine nor moonlight have ever
travelled as deep as you are right now. You loose all sense of time as
your mind enters the twilight zone. Could this be hell?
Flee as long as you can ...

As you swim through this dark blue, nearly black section of the ocean floor
you see a hideously large and extremely vicious shark swimming nearby amonst
the seaweed on the ocean floor. This makes you extremely apprehensive 
about venturing much further as you are positive he is looking for dinner.

Ocean floor~
You are swimming in the deepest depths on the bottom of the ocean floor.
Surrounding you are huge sharks with nashing teeth and mouths that would
swallow you whole. The large fish that also swim around the bottom of the
ocean are incredibly ugly and probably poisonous. However occassionly you 
catch glimpses of beautiful mermaids, creatures that you had thought were
only legends.

As you look around at the murky darkness that surrounds you on the bottom

incredibly hideous and nasty or amazingly beautiful. This is a place of sharp
contrasts and you wonder if you are possibly the first person to have ever
ventured this far.

You are standing inside a huge cavern.
Water drops from the walls giving this
whole scenery a fearsome background.
Your only exit is east and maybe you should
use it NOW!

Before a huge cavern~
You are standing before a huge black hole, which appears
to be a cavern. From the inside you hear screaming and 
as you try and turn around, you notice several
skeletons on the floor ...bones everywhere. You 
hear your inner voice screaming: 
"Run! Run as fast as you can!" 
...or was that 'as long as you can?'

created a natural spring.  Water bubbles upwards towards the surface.  You
wonder why this has happened, it seems an awfully odd occurrance for the ocean
floor.

Cavern~
You stand in a huge cavern so huge in fact,  that your light source cannot 
illuminate it all and parts of it remain in the dark. The shadows of the giant
stalagmites and stalactites look grotesque and seem to dance as
you turn your head in order to look around. Here and there you see 
strange symbols carved out of the rock and you wonder who would go so far 
below the earth's surface to leave traces of themselves.

Cavern~
A small underwater river streams in gurgling from the north. The water seems 
fresh and clear. The river has carved itself a way around the stalagmites.
It is very noisy here as the walls throw back the echo from the boiling 
water. As you listen to this natural sound you get the impression as if 
there was another sound, a man made sound in the background, but you 
quickly push away this thought as it is only your wish for civilisation.

Ocean floor~
You are swimming in the deepest depths on the bottom of the ocean floor.
Surrounding you are huge sharks with nashing teeth and mouths that would
swallow you whole. The large fish that also swim around the bottom of the
ocean are incredibly ugly and probably poisonous. However occasionally you 
catch glimpses of beautiful mermaids, creatures that you had thought were
only legends.

As you walk along the golden hall you notice why it is named like this,
the ceiling is made of pure gold with precious carvings telling stories
otherwise long forgotten. If you look closely you see it illustrates the
story of evolution of all being. Now if only you had more time to study it
you would even stand a chance of becoming wise... but then again that's not

between boys and girls, with the usual explanations why either boys are 
better than girls or girls are better than boys. What did you expect?
Kids are kids whether they live above or below the water.

You are walking through a heavily decorated corridor in the castle.
To the left and right paintings and treasures of the sea decorate the walls.
The semi-transparent aqua-dyed seaweed curtains are tied back with shells,
leaving you a view to the palace gardens, and the eternal darkness of the
abyss below.
The hallway continues north and south from here.

Golden hall~
As you walk along the golden hall you notice why it is named like this,
the ceiling is made of pure gold with precious carvings telling stories
otherwise long forgotten. If you look closely you see it illustrates the
story of evolution of all being. Now if only you had more time to study it
you would even stand a chance of becoming wise... but then again that's not
the purpose of your visit here, so forget about it and move on.
The hall continues north and south from here.

and it's only dimly light by some terrible smelling seaweed torches.
The corridor ends abruptly here, you think of the possibility that this might
once have been a secret passage but if so it's long gone. Time to turn back.

Inside a shipwreck~
The wreck lies here for centuries.
But here and there you can see some of the remains of the ancient glory 
and luxury of this ship, but most of it has gone - washed away by the sea.
On the walls and floor grow now corals and anemones, fish swim in and out
the hatches.

You swim through a thick seaweed forest that seems to go on

because the density of the seaweed block your view from everything
that may surround you. You are beginning to feel hopelessly lost

You stand on on the doorstep of an old shack that lies amonst the sand
dunes. You notice that there is an old wooden door here. As you look at
the shack you also notice how weather beaten and bleached the wood panels
have become. Obviously this shack has been here for quite a long time.
To your east you can see the beautiful white sandy beach that is cluttered

Atop a tall cliff~
The view over the ocean and the beach is breathtaking. 
The sound of the braking waves relaxes you and you watch
for a while the surfers catching the waves. 
You can follow the cliff to the south or test your skill and try to
dive into the ocean far below.

As you examine the surrounding walls closer you notice the wall to the west
is made of sandstone, the eastern wall is lime and covered with a large
LimeRelief. The southern wall is a blend of both.

You float through the deepest of all depths. This is one of the darkest
places the planet has to offer. Neither sunshine nor moonlight have ever
travelled as deep as you are right now. You loose all sense of time as
your mind enters the twilight zone. Could this be hell?
Flee as long as you can ...
