overgrown fauna.  The forest to the South, East and West is impassable.  A HUGE

you can see the layout of the Enfan town as well as scribbled notes attached
detailing estimates of the Enfans forces and locations. Several sheets of

Closed in room~
Stepping out of the portal you appear to have arrived inside a tree. In the
wall is a small hole letting in sunlight. But how could you fit inside a tree
unless you were ALOT smaller ? Looking around it appears at first as if you
are trapped, but upon closer inspection a small trapdoor is cunningly built
into the 'roof' of the room, almost indistinguishable from the rest of the 
surroundings. Where could it lead to ?

Catepillar cage~
A large hollow within the tree forms a junction between three corridors leading
east, west and south, but all your eyes can see is the catepillar in it's
cage. It looks no different to any other catepillar you have ever seen - except
it is three feet high and about fifteen feet long. How could a beast of
such size exist ?

A hollowed out area of the tree is a focal point of activity. Fairies pass
by you with a suspicious glance before continuing on their way. Smells of

from the north wall and a small passage leads to the south. A large arch
leads to east through to a large circular room.

Ballroom~
Hollowed out from the tree the ballroom is a magnificent blend of natural and
'fairy-made' wonder. The floor, walls and roof of the chamber are polished till
they shine from the light. And a stranger light source you have not seen. In
the centre of a glittering chandilier is what looks like a giant firefly. The
light from it passes through the chandelier making patterns that dance across
the walls and floor. The grand room is currently not in use though the fairies
most likely back in the main part of their home to the west, although you can
hear the sound of ernest debate coming from the throne room to the east.

has several fairies gathered around it.

The Main Hall~
   Amazing patterns and dazzling images crowd your mind.
Swirling visual illusions make you reel and almost fall over.
There are exits north and south to small chapel like areas and
in the east wall a small door leading who knows where?

Cleric's Sanctum~
   You feel quite out of place in here. On the walls lie shelves
which haven't seen the love of a cleaner in what is apparently
centuries. Many books lie about them and there are some scrolls
on the table before you. You suddenly feel uneasy and you look
around.
