In the Master Bedroom!~
The room is tastefully furnished with a 4 Poster Bed in the middle of the room.
The normal accessories are there chest of drawers, blanket box and a cot. To 
the north there is a set of French doors that are closed! There are rustling 
noises coming from all around and snickering from within the blanket box!

Outside the French Doors~
The view is spectacular! In the distance is the City of the Goblins and the 
castle of the Goblin King at the top. Surrounding the city is the labyrinth! 
To the east is the clock that is counting Sarah's hours down. The area around 
is very barren and not much lives up here.

The Path Out !~
The light is bright after being enclosed in the dark Oubliet! The path 
out is covered with roots and vines, obviously a long time since someone 
has used the exit to the Oubliet. Around you is an underground tunnel 
that leads further north. It is sandy and dimly light. Ahead and beside 
you are great sand walls that are all around you. The roof of the tunnel
is high up in the inky blackness. Hoggle starts to move on to the north, 
walking merrily along the trail.

As you and Hoggle wander along you notice the walls have giant faces carved

There is one stone that starts up his warning speach and Hoggle tells

you just move along?

Walking through an opening in the wall you see the crystal roll 
towards a little man sitting on the rocks. He picks up the crystal 
and asks What are you doing? So what do you think of my Labyrinth? 
A peice of cake? How is this for interesting? AS he says that he 
throws the crystal ball down the tunnel and it turns into a silver 
thing that moves rapidly towards you!

Beside the Wall!~
Finally you are standing on solid ground again!&n
Sarah is standing next to Hoggle and she is so happy with&n
him for helping out that she bends over and tries to kiss him!&n
Hoggle yells out "No don't do that! Now what did you go and do that for?"&n
Just as he finishes saying that you feel the earth shake and rumble and&n
the ground slides out from under your feet!&n

Nobody knows why the stopped but it is once again little Hoggle&n

has the most intense blue eyes that seem to pearce through your body and
look directly at your soul.  There are other people around him that seem 
to be laughing and enjoying the show he is performing.  The music becomes
louder as the band reach the pinnacle of their song and nearly tear the walls

locked up in a crystal ball with no obvious exits into the real world.  There is
a group of people all laughing around a strange looking bird that is sitting in a box
and has a evil laugh of it's own.

The hypnotic affect that the band has on this crowd is interesting as the music
itself is a loud raucous noise that has no rythm or melody to it but the dancers
seem to find it for themselves.

but that would mean crossing the dance floor once more.
The walls of the crystal ball are visible from here and
they have a opaque quality to them.  The candle light reflects
off them in a very stunning way! That explains why there are
so few candles but the place is well lit as the walls reflect
the candle light back into the room!

being blown about on the wind.  There is no obvious exit out of the
crystal ball and the mad party that is happening within, unless
someone does something silly like breaking the crystal ball itself!
Throwing or even just dropping a chair on the floor would 
probably make it bounce back at you, or would it?

In A Bedroom~
This is a typical teenagers room.  There is a single bed
standing in the middle of the room and a desk off to one
side against the bedroom wall.  There are lots of pictures
hanging off the walls.  On one wall there is a dolls house hanging
from it with several teddy bears sitting within.  There is a bookcase
on the other wall opposite the desk that has ornaments on top and books
within.  A thick layer of dust has blanketted the room from years of disuse.

At the Desk~
A desk is standing here against the wall. It looks like
an ordinary desk you would find in any teenager's room.
On the wall is a mirror with pictures hanging off it.
There is a teddy bear that looks old and rather well loved
sitting forgotten on the desk.  There is also lipstick and 
some books that have been written apon that have been left discarded
There is a thick layer of dust apon everything.

At the Edge of the Garbage Tip.~
To the south is the garbage tip with its strange inhabitants,
rotting food and disused furniture.  To the north is the path that
leads to the goblin city.  The ultimate goal for Sarah and her
band of intersting friends she has made along the way. Ludo, Hoggle,
Sir Didimus and Lancelot.  This is the beginning of the end for them.
they are happy they made it and Sarah still has time to save Toby!
Remember! That is what this whole place is all about! 13 Hours to
save Toby before the Goblin King claims him for the rest of his life.

Path to the Goblin City.~
Standing on the outer limits of the garbage tip you get a 
magnificent view of the goblin city that is hidden behind an ominous
wall. The path meanders down to the city gates. From this point Sarah
can also see a sleeping guard at the gate and the gates themselves are
very elaborate construction of steel and there is a huge filagre on it of
an impressive looking goblin warrior.

The Goblin City Gates~
The gates are massive, 10 foot high and 10 foot across.  It is amazing that
considering your average size of a goblin why whould they want to build such
big gates?  But this is an impressive piece of work, the goblin warrior that is
embossed onto the gate looks rather fierce and if he was real would make a very
serious opponent!  The guards that are supposed to be protecting the gate have
a serious nazel problem, their snoring is soo loud you would think they couldn't
sleep through the racket they are making!

Inbetween the two city gates~
This area between the two gates is devoid of life and there really isn't much
room for Sarah and her friends to move.  The goblins were obviously very
worried about being attacked as their defences are strong and to have two gates
nearly on top of one another means they didn't want easy access to the city for
the maruading monsters.

The Street through the Goblin City~
Walking through the inner wooden gates the street heads east through the city.
This isn't a very rich city.  The street is only a dirt track that works it's
way passed very run down looking houses.  All the houses are made of stone and
are of a crued nature.  The goblin kings castle is at the end of this street.
Sarah, Hoggle, Ludo, Sir Didmus and Lancelot are all heading towards the
castle, as Sarah only has 30 minutes left before Toby becomes a goblin.

Fighting in the City streets.~
The goblin king is not pleased! He has sent out his warriors to try
and delay Sarah and her party. There is a lot of fighting going on around every
courner and in every house! Will the goblin king win or will Sarah find Toby in 
time and break the spell that has her trapped within this world?

Running up the stairs~
Finally they have won their way through and they all run frantically
up the stairs of the Goblin King castle.  The end is drawing near and Sarah
knows there isn't much time left for her but she now knows that she can win
her way through and life isn't fair after all!

Inside the Goblin King Castle~
Once inside there is no sign of Toby or the Goblin King.  Hoggle is standing in
the middle of the room.  Sarah is heading up the stairs as this is the only
place left to look.  She has left her new found friends to clean up the last
bit of goblin resistance that they are encountering, while Sarah has to find
Toby as she only has 10 minutes to go!

Ascending to the Maze of Stairs.~
Sarah is climbing the last flight of stairs, hoping that this will lead her to
Toby and break the magic that binds her to this terrible and very unfair world.
If she makes it to Toby within the next 5 minutes she can reclaim her brother
from the Goblin King and return to her world with her brother!

The room of Stairs!~
On entering the room that Sarah was ascending to there is a void where the
stairs where.  The room is made up of a maze of stairs.  The void runs down the
middle of the room and from every angle the stairs run around the void.  Some
of the stairs are upside down the others defy the laws of gravity.  The Goblin
King is walking around the room, pacing as he knows that his time is limited
and he can no longer stop Sarah from reclaiming Toby.
