Closet.~
A damp and sorrid smell assaults your nostrils as you enter this dark and 
dingy closet. Peering around in the darkness, you can make out the shape of 
some boxes stacked on the floor. You can also see some other things stacked 
behind the BOXES, but from the smell that comes from that direction it would 
probably be better if you didn't know what was there.

You have come to an intersection of paths here. it is decision time now. 
Do you go East towards the pantry, West to the closet or back to the South where 
all the food is. But then maybe the pantry has some good food in it and no-one
would ever know where is had gone. Hmmmmmm food.

Path to pantry.~
As your start your way down the path to the pantry, you hear your stomach 
start to grumble at the thought of food. You feel your mouth start to water 
just at the thought, and you lick your lips in anticipation. Sure hope there 
is some nice treats in the pantry, and also that you don't get caught taking 
anything.

Pantry.~
SHELVES line the walls of this pantry. Upon every shelf is jars and jars of 
different food types. There is also a large selection of bags of grains and 
flours. Not much to take for a quick snack though. Looks like your stomach 
will have to keep grumbling till dinner time. Oh well....

The walls here are stacked with rifles and other weapons. Looks like someone

condition. Wonder who the poor person who has to keep it all looking great is. 
Sure glad it isn't me though, would take you forever to clean all these weapons.

room. But then you could always just go back South and try to find your way out
of here.

You are standing is a semi well lit passage way. To the East you can follow a 
passage to the Colonel's Office, but do you dare go that way. Or you can go South 
which is also a path to the Colonel's Office. Hmmm which way did I come from? 
Which way should I be going? I can't seem to remember hmm........

This passage feels like it has been going forever. Or is that just the day you 
have been having? Candles flicker in the slight breeze that you can feel flow 
across your face. What were you coming this way for? Ah that's right you wanted
to see the Colonel. But what if he's in a bad mood? Guess you will just have 
to try your luck.

This passageway looks just like all of the others around. It has wooden log 
walls, candles burning in holders along the walls nothing real exciting. You 
can hear the vague sounds of people walking around outside, and horses 
snorting in discontent. But in all it is still rather quiet and serene in 
this passageway.

As you step into this part of the passageway, you get the feeling it is just 
like all the others. They really aren't very big on variety of passageways 
here. Although they do seem to like the wood log look. They really should do 
something about the lighting though. To the West is a passageway where that 
goes you have no idea.

feet in front of yourself. To the East and West you can vaguely make out the 
doors of dingy holding cells. To the South you can see sunlight that must be

some fresh air.

You can feel yourself nearing the storerooms. You start to rub your hands 
together in anticipation of what you may find there. There is normally 
something extra that you manage to hide away as a special treat for yourself. 
The only problem is which storeroom to go into first?

path back to the main part of the building leads you back out to fresh air. 
Looking at the walls of this passageway you can see glimmers of light 
filtering through the cracks in the wall. You get the feeling that this fort 
was built in a hurry, and they rushed it just a little too quickly.

wall and a couple of chairs on the opposite side of the room. Someone has 
dropped some PAPERS on the floor here, as thought they left in a hurry and 
didn't notice that they dropped them. You guess that they can't be very

CREEKKKKKKKKKKK, the doors squeaks loudly as you open the door to this cell. 
The smell in here is a lot better than most of the cells. From the looks of 
it this cells doesn't get as much use as the others. As you peer around the 
room you see something written on the wall. It says 'This is the cell
where I Chief Ironhawk have been kept a prisoner against my will, you can
be sure that I will exact revenge from the people involved in my capture and 
restraint here. Whether that be in spiritual or physical life, I WILL get my 
REVENGE!!!!!!' Hmmmm maybe that's why this cell have been left vacant.

Holding cells can be found all along this pathway. Some of the cells have

people in the cells at the moment. Things must be peaceful around this area, 
with no trouble stirring. Apparently some of these cells have held up to 15 
people at a time in busy periods.

The speed with which they people get the dishes done is quite unbelievable. 
They are all quite happy to be doing their chores and they sing little ditties

know where they are going, so you will just have to take pot luck with which 
direction you go. You can either go North or South to the storerooms. The 
path to the North seems to be the more frequently used path from the looks

that way you don't need to light lanterns during the day. Ahhhh now it all

You find the path here very quiet and serene. You don't think that this is 
a place that the public gets to see very often. There is no people running 
around on important errands here and the path is empty of everyone and 
everything.

Colonel's office. You look around to make sure no-one is in sight before you 
take those few steps and enter the Colonel's special sanctum.

This cell doesn't seem to smell as bad as all the rest. That might be because 
of the window in the wall here. There is no glass in the barred window which 
makes this cell really cold. You shiver as the wind gusts through the bars, 
blowing your clothes around you. Maybe the smell would be better than this 
wind and cold. But then again perhaps it would be better just to stay out of 
here full stop.

Turn in pathway.~
This is a gentle bend in a pathway. Exits lead North and West from here. You 
seem to be walking down hill slightly as you move to the West and uphill to 
the South. Dust seems to have accumulated in the South-eastern side of the 
path where the wind has blown it.

Everywhere you seem to turn along this path you come across Intersections. 
There doesn't seem to be any signs to let you know what is down each path 
either. The soldiers that live here must just know where everything is and 
don't need signs. But what about new people that come to the fort, what do 
they do??? Well I guess they will find their way around eventually with a 
little experimenting.

You are walking along a well used path. To your north you can see a large 
area that is just a dust pit. There is no plants or anything growing in this 
large empty area. The path continues off to the East and West and your feet 
stumble a little as you tread into the occasional ditch.

to have been made in the path over the years by so many people having walked 
down this path. You can just about visualise the men walking down here after 
a hard days riding, scuffing their feet and just wanting to eat and go to bed.

Someone seems to have built a rail along the path here. It is extremely 
notched and has many a nick and cuts in it, in fact it looks as is it would 
fall over if you even touched it. It doesn't look very stable at all. Why 
would they have a rail here anyway. To the East is the Sleeping Quarters and 
to the West is a path back to the main path. So there isn't really any need 
for a rail to be here. Maybe someone was just bored one day or it might have 
had a purpose once upon a time, who knows...

Suddenly a strong gust of wind blows from behind you, and you feel a shiver

get the feeling someone is watching you. Off to the East you can see the 
Sleeping Quarters of the soldiers stationed here. Is that someone looking
out their window at u?? Now you can't see anything in the window. Was it just 
your imagination or was there really someone there.

could ever want. It has lots of fresh dry hay laying on the ground and a huge 
barrel of water and even a bucket of oats in the corner. Since this is the 
colonel's own private horse it is no wonder that he is looked after very well.

that's where the tracks lead from.

stall. Hearing a rustling sound you look around and see a horse start to 
stand up from the pile of hay that was in the middle of the floor. Snorting 
madly he glares at you and you frantically look for a way out. The only way 
out is to the West...RUN!!!!!!

and lots of bunkbeds just waiting for those tired and dirty soldiers to come 
drop into them. Most of the soldiers in this room are very tidy, but one seems 
to be having trouble fitting everything into his box at the end of his bunk, 
the main reason for this is that his guitar doesn't fit into it, and he has it 
leaning up along side of his bed. The rest of his stuff seems to be quite tidy,
but it just doesn't look as spotless as the others.

gently blow against your face. It seems so still and tranquil here at the 
moment, you wish that it could be like this always.

This seems to be a guards post. There isn't much that distinguishes it for any 
other part of the path, except that the holes in the side of the wall seem to 
be a bit larger and there is a few extra ones that let the guards see further 
into the distance.

there would be an element of danger in being on watch at night, when the 
enemy can creep up on you unawares. You would have to be really alert to take 
on this shift.
