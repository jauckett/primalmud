Loadind Dock~
You have entered the very very large loading dock of the Red Dwarf.  This huge
spaceship is proudly owned by the Jupiter Mining Company!  It's mission is to
go to deep space and mine for precious minerals and ores!  But somewhere along
the way something went horribly horribly wrong!  This dock is HUGE!  It has to
be as it houses Starbug I, Starbug II and the Blue Midget!

Starbug I~
This area of the dock houses Starbug 1, there is a huge set of doors behind you
for the Starbug to leave the ship.  These doors are always open for a quick
escape from the ship as you never know when you will need one!

Starbug II~
This is where Starbug II is docked when it lands from its small exploration
missions that it is sent out on!  Behind you is a huge set of doors that are
open so Starbug II can have immediate access to the loading dock when it
returns

Loading Dock~
As you move further through the Loading Dock you can see Blue Midget parked off
to your right.  Infront of you is a set of stairs and the entrance to the ship
via the air seal.

Blue Midget~
This is the area of the Loading Dock that houses the Blue Midget!  It is parked
behind Starbug I and takes careful manouvering to get it out when Starbug is
parked infront of it!

Up the Stairs~
You have climbed to the top of the metal stairs and directly infront of you is
the Air Lock.  To activate the air lock you have to push the red button that
is located on the wall!  This will open the lock and let you pass through!

In the Air Lock~
You are in the Air Lock, air has been pumped into the room so it is now safe to
remove your helmet and proceed into the ship itself.  To do this you must push
the green button to open the ships inner doors.  If you want to move back into
the Loading Dock it is a wise idea to wear a vacuum suit before you push the red
button again!

In the Loading Area~
As you walk clear of the Air Lock you find yourself in a long corridor with a
the elevator doors at the end!  This ship has 2590 floors so it is required you
use an elevator to get to the level required.  Considering there was a
radiation leak that wiped out the entire crew except Dave Lister who was in the
statis chamber and the cat known as Frankenstein, not all levels have been
de-contaminated from high levels of radiation!  Only the brave go to the floors
that are not clean!  To get back into the air lock you must push the green
button!

End of Loading Area~
You have walked down the long corridor, ahead of you is the doors for the
elevator and to your left and right is a massive storage area.  Down here they
store all the cargo waiting to go on the Starbugs and all the incoming freight
that has been sent to the ship!  There are boxes stacked from floor to nearly
the ceiling and there is no room to move around those boxes.

the door never got fixed so you can't access the Botanical Gardens

it is still painted with the same colour, ocean grey, but the engineers had to
come up with something different so they could work out where they were talking
about when looking at the plans for this ship!

thing that makes this corridor different from the others is it is referred to
as Corridor 159 white!

beds.  Lister sleeps in the top one and it has posters plasted all over the
walls.  The bottom bunk is used by RIMmer and he has his usual revision
schedule for another exam stuck to one wall and a !Smoking sign just above his
pillow!  There is a couch sitting against one wall and in the middle of the
room is a table and chair.  On the other side of the door is two lockers where
Dave and RIMmer can hang their clothing.  The only clothing RIMmer hangs in
there is his jocks on coathangers!

Captain's Office.~
You have entered the office that Captain Hollister uses to supervise the senior
offices of the Drive room!  He has a very good view of the entire drive room.
There is a desk and chair in the middle of the room and all along the walls are
cabinets that have important paperwork in them.  In the corner of the room
hanging off a coat stand is a very large yellow chicken suit!

Reflectory Room~
This is a small room where the Captain holds small meetings with the senior
officers.  This room is also used for the wakes and the Welcome back Parties.
Sometimes the Captain has to perform Weddings in this room as well.  In this
room are table and chairs all in neat rows.  There is a huge LCD Panel mounted
on the wall for Holly to appear on.  The walls are all painted in a bright blue
colour and have pictures hanging all over them.

though it is classified as the Officer's Mess.  They have a disco in this room
every Friday and Saturday night.  You can find tables and chairs over to one
side and disco lights and a disco ball hanging from the ceilinig.

After stepping out of the elevator you find yourself in a corridor that will
take you directly to the ship's cinema.  There is usually a movie always
playing at the cinema as it is one of the sources of entertainment for the crew
to enjoy!

suite!  The corridor is nothing spectacular to look at as it is painted in the
same dull looking Ocean Grey paint that all the corridors have been painted in.

454.  As you peer down corridor 454 you start to notice that it is still
painted in that same dull colour - Ocean Grey - but the lighting has made it
appear a dark blue colour!
