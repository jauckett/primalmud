Path through snowfield~
   You walk along a path, blanketed in white.  The chilled wind rustling your
hair.  Light snowflakes float to the ground, the air, fresh.  Mountain ranges
dominating the view around you.  Things get noticeably cooler as you head
southward, to the east there is a vast abyss.

Before a lake of ice.~
   Before you, lies a great white lake, continually frozen courtesy of the
constant cold temperatures as you near the pole.  Penguins skate about with
ease, occasionally bumping into each other.  They make it look trivial to move
about.  To the north, the weather starts to get a little warmer.

On top of a frozen lake~
   The forever cold temperature in this part of the world has caused a layer of
ice to form on the top of this lake.  Passage across is somewhat safe, with the
exception of being rather slippery.  The local life however, has decided this
lake makes for an excellent ice skating ring.  You may continue to cross the
lake to the south, and east.

Below the ice layer.~
   In your foolishness, you have managed to break through the ice layer that
makes the surface of this lake.  The water is absolutely freezing down here,
and you only have a short amount of time before the hole seals itself up, it
would probably be a good idea to climb out of here, fast.

cave.  The cave seems to continue on to the north, with the sealed lake,
outside.  There is a faint smell of animal in the air, coming from the north.

A fork in the path~
   You have stumbled upon a fork in the path, the divide giving you the option
of either continuing on north, where the path continues, west, where the path
turns north, and south, where the path begins winding its way east.

Winding path through forest~
   This winding path through the forest seems rather devoid of life for some
reason you can't uncover.  Only typical scavengers make up the wildlife
population.  Trees still loom overhead here, blocking the sun way above your
head.  The path continues to the north and east.

End of a winding path~
   You have reached the end of this winding path through the forest, the trees
and shrubbery not allowing passage in any direction, other than the return
west.  The ground here seams a little softer than other areas within this
forest.

Path through forest~
   You wander through the snow-covered forest, trees looming overhead creating
a canopy that your light does not penetrate.  One of the trees here has limbs
low enough for you to reach, it might be possible for you to climb to it's top.
To the north, the path continues, and to the south, the path forks.

Path through forest~
   You wander through the snow-covered forest, trees looming overhead creating
a canopy that your light does not penetrate.  Small forest animals scatter
about the scrub, most likely trying to stay away from larger ones.  The path
continues both to the north, and south.

In a Roc's nest~
   Atop the canopy here, you find yourself in the nest of a Roc.  You better
hope the owner does not come home to find you here, or there might be trouble
to pay beyond your capabilities.  Looking around, you can make out two other
rather similar nests in the distance, however, the only way you might reach
them is by climbing up from the ground once more.  The canopy failing to
provide any path.  Your only retreat here is down below.

Beneath the snow~
   Climbing down through the hole, you find yourself in an old penguins nest,
which appeared to have been covered up.  Oddly though, this nest appears to
have been created a long time ago, however it's inhabitants seem to still use
it.  There's not much to see besides dirt and straw, the only way out, to climb
back up.

   You find yourself upon a small land mass that seems to be floating in the

the ground you are standing on, you cannot see anything but the vastness of
