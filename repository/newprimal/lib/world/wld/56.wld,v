Entrance into the Black Tower~ 
You stand in the entrance room to the Black Tower. Surrounding you are 
skulls of human heads with pieces of flesh and hair still clinging to
them. The smell that assaults your senses from the corridors beyond
nearly makes you turn back in fear. There is a small sign stuck on the 
tower wall that warns you not to enter.

sign~
               In the greenest of our valleys
                 By good angels tenanted,
               Once a fair and stately palace,
                Radiant palace - reared its head.
                  But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
               Assailed the monarchy's high estate.
                  And travellers now, within that valley,
                Through the red-litten windows see
               Vast forms, that move fantastically
                    To a discordant melody,
                    Through the pale door
               A hideous throng rush out forever
                 And laugh - but smile no more.

creatures wander. As you walk through this maze cobwebs hit you in the 
face and cling to your clothes. The cold grey walls offer no clues as to 
which direction you should take and you have to rely on your own sense of 
direction.

You are standing in the entrance to a maze of rooms that may possibly 
lead to an amazing treasure or possibly nowhere at all. The rooms twist 
and wind around each other and venturing ahead may soon be a lesson in 
survival. To your north you see the dark corridor where, although the 
smell is repulsive, you have a much better sense of direction.

You are standing in a rather long dark hallway that leads into the centre

stairway and south you see the dark hallway. There is a turn in the dark 
hallway just ahead, so visibility is very limited. However you sense a 
strong evil surrounding you and wonder if it is safe to move further along
into the centre of the tower.

stumble into his den. Very few escape from here so you should flee now

The grey slate stairs~
You are standing on the grey slate stairs leading up into the centre of 
the Black Tower. Looking around you see slime oozing and dripping down the 
stairs and sticking to the soles of your boots. On the ceiling above are 
small creatures that drop down onto your shirt. From the corners of the 
dark stairs red eyes glare back at you in hunger thinking you may be 
their next meal. As you look up you see the top of the stairs and down below
is the bottom of the stairs and a dark hallway.

fearful of proceeding ahead as you begin to realise danger surrounds you

Tower is an extremely dangerous place where many a brave warrior has 
perished. If you look down you can see that the slate stairs leading into 
the dark hallway also hold many perilous monsters that quickly attack 
any passing stranger. You are unsure whether you should continue in 
either direction as the dangers are grey and numerous.

that whatever lies toward the south will not be pleasant as you are entering
into the most evil section of the tower and the evil ruling queen could be
living nearby. As you look around through the gloomy shadows you see flashes
of red eyes and gnashing teeth belong to the small vicious creatures who have
been watching your every move. They are carnivorous beasts that wait for the
scraps that large creatures leave behind.

spiders and cobwebs and you wonder why this is so. Is this possibly a 
magic room? Looking north you see the dark hallway where the slime and

time to admire the view as standing here is the most evil creature in the 
whole of this Tower. The beast standing here grins evilly at you as it 
prepares to attack. You have entered its lair and very few survive who enter
into here, you quickly realise as you survey all the bones and skeletons
that lie scattered on the floor at your feet. The smell of this beast is

Entrance to Black hallway~
This dark and dismal entrance leads upwards towards the top of the Black 
Tower. A cold shiver runs down your spine as you hear a horrible wailing from
the top of the tower. If you look up you can not see anything but a pitch 
blackness that shrouds you in an evil aura that surpasses the most 
hideous and vile things you can possibly imagine. No devil or creature 
could be more evil that what lies ahead at the top of this tower. The 
most sensible option open to you is head back to Haven while you still 
have a chance.

You have become hopelessly lost within a maze of rooms that twist and turn 
around each other making it impossible to determine which way is east, 
west, north or south. Looking at the walls does not help you either, as 
they all look exactly the same. All the walls are made up of grey slate 
that is so smooth and cold that not a single mark or scratch is visible on
any of them. You will just have to blindly stumble on in the hope that 
you will find an exit.

red eyes glare back at you in hunger and desire. A desire to see your

blood and intestines, their favourite meal. Daring to walk through this 
evil tower has possibly forfeited your life. You should wisely head back

You are standing in a damp cellar of the black tower where a hideous

that falls onto the damp dirty floor and forms stagnant pools at your feet.
This place is so dark, dismal and wet that very few creatures that reside in
the black tower choose to live here. Also the hideous beast standing over you
eats anything that comes into its lair, the bottom of the cellar. The 
smell in this room is so revolting that you nearly flee in terror and 
this smell isn't just the stagnant water it is the creature also. Mixed 
together it makes it nearly impossible to breath.

You see a beautiful lace covered feather mattress and huge large pillows 
where you can lay your head down to sleep. Just looking at this bed makes 
you feel tired.

sign~
This room has been designed for the weary traveller to rest in, peacefully
away from the harm of evil creatures. Feel quite free to sleep on the bed
in the corner as you will quickly feel more refreshed here than in any other
part of the Tower.

Labyrinth of rooms~
You have become hopelessly lost in this maze of rooms. The cold grey slate
walls offer few solutions to which way you should head in. The only
thing you have to guide you through these rooms is that hideous wailing sound
that you keep hearing. However it also echoes off the walls making it 
difficult to tell which direction it is actually coming from.

In all direction you see a maze of rooms with no distinguishing features 
to help you locate where you are. The walls in this section of the tower are
relatively bare of slime and cobwebs, but there is a hideous wailing sound
that bounces off the walls and echoes all around you. It is so hideous 
that you feel like fleeing in terror.

Entrance to the Labyrinth~
The entrance to the labyrinth of rooms is an impressive grey slate room
devoid of slime and cobwebs. On either side of the entrance there are two 
stone gargoyles that look rather hideous and scary. They represent the 
guardians of the Black Tower and if you happen to see one move you should
flee as quickly as possible. The entrance has three possible exits into 
the labyrinth, but only one is the correct way through the rooms.

Exit of the Labyrinth~
You have made your way through the maze of rooms that it is quite easy to get
completely lost in. However the wailing sound you occasionally heard in the
Labyrinth of rooms is now louder. It sends a cold shiver down your spine 
as you realise what lies ahead must be a hideous, vile creature that rules
the Black Tower. It may be safer if you head back to Haven rather than 
continuing on from here.

The fear that seeps quickly into your veins makes you feel like fleeing while
you still have a chance. You are positive that whatever lies below will 
not be pleasant.

look down the blackest hallway but you can not make out anything ahead. 
However you sense a great evil coming from the depths below.

End of The Blackest Hallway~
You are standing at the bottom of this very steep black hallway. This is the 
bottom section of the tower and looking down you can see a large black 
room that looks rather impressive and forbidding. To enter into the black
room will probably mean certain death as this is where that hideous wailing
sound is coming from. As you look around the room you are standing in you 
notice a pile of broken bones in one corner, piled up to the ceiling. 
This makes you feel very reluctant to continue to down into what is so
obviously a death trap.

You are standing in the large black room at the very bottom of the Black 
Tower. The beast standing here grins evilly at you as it prepares to 
attack. You have entered its lair and very few survive that dare to enter, 
which you quickly realise as you survey all the bones and skeletons
that lie scattered on the floor at your feet. The smell of this beast is 
repulsive as it obviously never cleans itself or its lair and you feel 
like fleeing in terror before it attacks you.
