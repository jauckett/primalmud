Outside gates~
Solid steel gates stand wide open as you approach the city. The gates are a 
foot wide! Magic must help open and close them, they are far too heavy to be 
moved by the hand of man. The tall city walls stretch 50 feet above the ground 
and through the open gates you can see the walls themselve are 30 or 40 feet 
of solid stone. Only a very large army or one with powerful magic wielding 
allies could hope to take the city without been slaughtered.

Southern highway~
Filling your vision to the north is the great wall surrounding the city
of Impulzarr. The wall stretchs for miles across to the east and out west
across the sea, guarding the large harbour of this coastal city.

Southern highway~
The Southern highway is the least busy of the three land bound ways into the
city of Impulzarr - but the paved road is still wide enough forthree wagons 
to travel abreast and the city still patrols it vigilantly.

Southern highway~
A small troop of cavalry from the city to the north travels down the highway.
The paved stone road is wide enough that neither you nor they need move aside.
With a searching glance the troop dig their heels in and continue southwards,
ensuring bandits and smaller jealous cities don't stop trade into or out
of the city.

Travelling along the smooth paved highway, runnning directly south from
the city, you can see a small campsite to the east - a regular stopping
point for weary travellers and traders making their way to the city.

Small hills rise up on either side of the wide road, but it carves through
them, turning to the west to the north. The hills here would make a perfect
place for an ambush by bandits, so keep a close eye out.

Southern highway~
Travelling along the highway you pass a merchants caravan heading towards
the city. A handful of guards ride alongside the wagons, looking like tree
trunks on horses, their arms as thick as most mens thighs. The only thing
harder then their muscles is probably the 'wood' between their ears.

Grasslands~
Off the highway grasslands stretch away to the east and south. Miles to the
north the city of Impulzarr dominates the horizon, the largest city for
many thousands of leagues. Out to the west cliffs overlook a vast ocean,
strong winds and crashing waves pounding against the cliff face.

Cliff face~
Near the Southern highway out of the city great cliffs overlook a vast ocean
of water. Looking over the cliff face far below you can see waves crash onto
sharp rocks. Even if you survived a fall from this height you'd soon be
pounded into small pieces in the large waves below.

Off to the side of the highway the grass is trampled from regular use as
a camping ground by weary travellers before the last leg to the city.
A small fire pit in the ground shows signs of regular use, blackened
bones from a recent meal still unclaimed by predators.

Short stunted growth no higher then your ankles are the only foliage over
the grass nearby, though you can see a small copse of trees off to the

one glance at you it dives back in quick enough to make you doubt your
eyes.

Inn~
A handful of empty tables and a small dirty fire place are the 'highlights'
of the towns inn. The few locals having a quiet drink stop talking and
look at you when you open the door. I don't think they get too many
strangers passing through these parts.

House~
Dusty shelves along one wall and dust covered rotting furniture in a way
tell the tale of the town. Perched near the Southern Highway of Impulzarr
the town has fallen on hard times of late due to war in the lands to the
south drying up much of the trade.

Filled with the produce of the local farmers. Cracked bricks to the rear of

Just visible under the swirling sands the Sun Road leads nort-west, eventually
to the great city of Impulzarr. Once it also lead to lands to the east,
before the desert appeared a century ago. Some say it was an act of a

whatever the cause the lands are slowly, but surely been buried under the

The walls of the city are incredibly thick - 30 to 40 wide. Even with
the magical aid used in its construction the vast walls took decades
to construct. When the walls were started barely a fifth of the area
inside the walls was covered with buildings. Now there is hardly any
space left unclaimed.

Although they take many times longer to load and fire the a longbow the
range of the device is a 100 yards further, able to reach beyond the

Called the Jewel of the North by it's citizens, less flattering things by

squashed against the walls. Two small doors, iron banded and with heavy 
locks lead out to the stairs up to the wall top and to the stores for 
this part of the wall.

iron rations for the soldiers, sharpening stones for swords, straps and 
a dozen other small items laid out with military precision. Quite an 
arsenal has been packed into the limited space.

Watch tower~
Standing high on the watchtower, you can see for miles in every direction. 
To the south the fiery desert, east across the vast plains of fields feeding 
the mighty city. To the west the sea of Stars, stretching to the horizon, 
beautiful, enchanting, merciless. And to the north, Impulzarr. Impulzarr. 
Called the Jewel of the North by it's citizens, less flattering things by 
smaller cities jealous of its power.

A small set of stone stairs set within the wall will take you up to the

and very thick. Glancing through the open doors you can see what appears 
to be quarters through one door, a small mess hall through the other.

Built into the walls of the city, the mess hall is spartan. Every three 
days, the watch changes and there is nothing to say soldiers will serve 
at the same place along the wall again soon. A rough wooden bench and 
table are jammed into the room, with barely room to sit without been 
squashed against the walls. Two small doors, iron banded and with heavy 
locks lead out to the stairs up to the wall top and to the stores for 
this part of the wall.

Although they take many times longer to load and fire the a longbow the
range of the device is a 100 yards further, able to reach beyond the
front lines of an incatious enemy.

the city to explode upon impact, greatly enhancing their destructive power.

squashed against the walls. Two small doors, iron banded and with heavy

Both archers and infantry patrol along the wall. The walls are wide enough
that enough a small cavalry charge could be mounted along it. An archer
walks past you her finger hovering near the bowstring of her long bow.

Mounted alongside the far wall looking out from the city is a large crossbow.
In times of need 2 or 3 soldiers would man the crossbow. One to aim the
device and another 1 or 2 ready to reload it as soon as a bolt is fired.
Although they take many times longer to load and fire the a longbow the
range of the device is a 100 yards further, able to reach beyond the
front lines of an incatious enemy.

The walls of the city are incredibly thick - 30 to 40 wide. Even with

inside the walls was covered with buildings. Now there is hardly any

Although they take many times longer to load and fire the a longbow the

Watch tower~
Looking out westward across the Sea of Stars, the watch tower is one of
many at regular intervals along the sea wall. On one side of the tower
is a small basin for a signal fire and below it several bags of chemicals 
to make plumes of smoke when thrown in the small fire to signal the 
mainland at night if any trouble is detected.

Stretching feet 50 feet high and 30 or 40 feet thick the strong stones walls
of the city have never been breached by hostile forces. Soldiers of the

Wall~
The walls of the city are incredibly thick - 30 to 40 wide. Even with
the magical aid used in its construction the vast walls took decades
to construct. When the walls were started barely a fifth of the area
inside the walls was covered with buildings. Now there is hardly any
space left unclaimed.

Wall~
The walls around the city are thick and solid rock. Mounted at regular
intervals are holes in the walls for archers to shoot down on targets 
below without exposing themselves to return fire. The walls are smooth
and hard - making it hard for scaling ladders and climbing invaders
to find purchase.

Mounted along the city wall is a large catapult, ready to hurl large boulders

but some of the boulders have been enchanted by mages in the service of
the city to explode upon impact, greatly enhancing their destructive power.

parts, the outer city and the inner city, nestled at the foot of a 'curve'

are welcome in the main part of the city, but the inner city contains
the wheels of government and homes of the cities nobles and the likes
of you aren't allowed entry without a gate pass.

Dungeons~
An unfinished passage way carved through the bedrock under the fortress
was never completed during construction of the fortress. More dungeons
were initially planned for here, but before it was completed the large
prison on the mainland was completed.

Cell~
A hard stone bench to sleep on and a slop bucket are the only 'comforts'
prisoners get in a small cell. The cell has no windows been down within
the fortress. The air is dank and humid, but the cell is only for short
term holding of prisoners caught in the seas surrounding the city, till
they can be shipped to the cities prisons on the mainland.

Sea wall~
Mounted along the sea wall is a large catapult, ready to hurl large boulders
at approaching ships. The device would be devastating enough on its own,
but some of the boulders have been enchanted by mages in the service of
the city to explode upon impact, greatly enhancing their destructive power.
Stairs lead down into down, to a passage deep beneath the harbours surface.

Standing on the sea wall, you can feel the cool breezes on your face and

To the west rough, choppy seas, water too turbulent to see beneath the 
surface. Within the harbour, clear seas, barely a ripple crossing the 
surface, allowing you to see deep into the harbour.

On the seas~
Moving out to sea the shoreline gets smaller, but the eastern skyline is
still dominated by Mount Impulzarr and the great city at its base. Deep
blue seas in every other direction lead to other far away lands, but 
where ?

On the seas~
Running up to the edge of Mount Impulzarr a large sea wall extends along 
to the south west. It rises upwards 50 feet from the waters surface.
Running your hand along it is as smooth as glass, but there are no chip
marks or hand holds anywhere across its surface that you can see.

Alongside the sea wall, the waves lap up against the wall rising high
out of the water. Looking down below beneath the surface of the water
the wall heads down as far as you can, the water here from 50 to 150
feet deep in places, the wall as thick all the way to the oceans floor.

High above the waters surface at the top of the walls, infantry and
archers patrol along the top of the sea wall running around the city
harbour. Occasionally one glances down at you, but only briefly - one
person is no threat to a city this size - at least in their eyes.

wall. Within the harbour gentle waves barely ripple the deep blue waters,
the harbour is very deep. Several ships have sunk in their time, but
goods and most of the unfortunate crews have been saved by the merfolk

the narrow passage through to the harbour is only wide enough for 2 or 3 
large ships to pass at a time. It keeps the harbourmaster busy scheduling

At the edge of the water you are boxed in on two sides. To the north by the

The strong ocean waves pound you against the cliff face, lifting you out
