Portal Room on Level 5~
Rainbows crawl over the walls in bursts, outlining the structure of the
room. The furniture and walls keep changing colours, stripes appearing and
running in random directions, as if a psychotic invisible clown is
maniacally running through the room with handfuls of paintbrushes. There
is a colourful portal in the middle of the room, spraying colour in all
directions.

Portal Room on Level 5~
Darkness seeps out from the centre of this room. You can just make out
the source of it, a dark portal in the middle leaking evil energy. You
sense that it is only now beginning to gain momentum, and once this tower
has been consumed, whatever force these mages have unleashed on the world
will expand outward, forever consuming, until there is nothing left.

Dark Portal~
Standing on the roof of the tower, no wind disturbs you despite the
incredible height. You suspect that the view would be magnificent, but
darkness lies like a blanket over the tower, smothering it. Through your
own arts you are able to penetrate the gloom and spot four short bridges  
leading north, south, east and west toward platforms that stand in front
of the arms you saw on the tower.
A dark portal is in the centre of the roof.

Throne of Destiny~
Surrounded by eternity, and stars beyond counting, you stand upon a
platform that contains  thousands of small planets slowly going around
thousands of small suns. The universe unfolds around you, and secrets
untold beg to be discovered, as they whisper their names to you, tempting
you. Here lies the centre of what the masters of the tower had hoped to
reach with their meddling. 
And here they met their match.

You are staring at a small wooden box, about 7 by 7 by 7 centimeters, inlaid
with gold leaf and no apparent joins.  The box has a certain "aura" surrounding
it, a blackness that you can't keep out of your head...  One of pain...  One of
hate...  And one of greed.

The light~
The darkness from the previous rooms seem a faint memory with the light here,
the naked streams of vision wash over your body with a caressing touch.  The
warmth makes your body feel alive again after so much pain and agony.  Slowly a
pinpoint of blackness becomes visible in the distance.  The only direction
availible is towards it.

The Configuration~
You are staring at a small wooden box, about 7 by 7 by 7 centimeters, 
inlaid with gold leaf and no apparent joins. The box has a certain "aura" surrounding it, a blackness that you can't keep out of your head...one of pain...one of hate...and one of greed.

The First Position~
As soon as you awaken you find that you have been sucked inside the box, and with the noises that you are hearing you are not sure if you were the only one awoken. With this in mind tread carefully, or your next step make be your last.

The Labyrinth Of LeMerchand~
You find yourself in a pit of total blackness not dark but black,
as if the light has been sucked out like a vacuum, the floor moves
with the agony of a thousand souls that have been tortured to the
brink of madness.

so much food for a glutton. The anguished souls cry out in a pain that balances between madness and torment.

The Abode Of The Cenobites~
The stench of death and decay abounds here, with thick viscous blood dripping from the walls with the sounds of pain and anguish echo here.

The jaggered meat hooks hang from the ceiling, with bloodied chains and other weapons that were only meant for one purpose, to kill or at least irreparably maim and mutilate.
