The end of a hall with many doors~
   Oh dear!  You are in the same hall as before but you are now the size of a
walnut.  The whitewashed doors are on either side are now towering above you.
The curtained door before you is now the right size!  How ever to the south you
see a small step you cant climb over to exit back into the tunnel.  Lets hope
you remembered the key!  The key!

hedge~
   This tall green hedge looks as if it has been standing here for a hundred
years by the thickness of its base.  However its leaves have been prunned back
with great care.  At the base of the hedge lies a small by curious rabbit-hole
thats leads downwards into blackness.

Down the rabbit-hole~
   Standing in the darkness you realise that the rabbit-hole leads down into
the deep darkness.  You do not know what lies within and you wonder whether to
risk any further exploration.  To your south lies the exit back out.

A dark tunnel~
   All that can bee seen from the tunnel is a bright light which radiates from
above your head at the tunnel entrance, below you lies pitch blackness and the
musty smell of mildrew and damp.  The air feels very thick in your lungs, the
earth sticky beneath your feet.

A dip in the tunnel.~
   Before you could think about stopping you realise you have dropped off the
edge and are slowly falling downwards.  The pace to which you are dropping is
very odd indeed as you are finding time to look about yourself but still find
it inpossible to see where the ground lies.

Falling through the air~
   Down, down, down.  Its seams that you are definately falling somewhere but
it feels as if you are falling forever.  As you fall you notice there are
peices of furniture, pictures and bookcases just hanging miraculously in the
air.  You wonder to yourself what latitude or longitude you have gotten too -
or whether if you fall any further will you find yourself in New Zealand or
Australia.

The conclusion of the tunnel~
   You have finally fallen to the end of your journey landing upon some soft
dried leaves.  Before you lies another long passage and in the very distance
you can see the scurrying of the small white rabbit in a waistcoat.

A corner in the tunnel~
   This long passage seems to stretch on into the unknown.  The ceiling itself
cannot be seen, only a blanket of darkness lies over head.  To your south lies
the bottom of the tunnel drop whilst to your east lies a hall.

A hall with many doors~
   The hall is brightly lit by a row of lamps hanging from the low roof above.
Many whitewashed doors lie on either side of the room.  To your east lies the
void into the darkness, white to the north is a further stretch of corridor.

The end of a hall with many doors~
   Reaching the very conclusion of the hall you look around to find on either
side are some more whitewashed doors.  To the north you notice a small
unobtrusive red velvet curtain about half your height.  To the south lies the
way back out.

At the base of a hedge ~
   The sun streams down in thick glowing rays from the gaps within the canopy
of leaves and trees towering overhead.  A masterfully sculptured hedge lies to
the north of you, whilst surrounding your immediate person lies a field of
pretty white daisies just begging to be made into a chain.

The end of a hall with many doors~
   Oh dear!  You are in the same hall as before but you are now the size of a
elephant.  The whitewashed doors are on either side are now the size of shoe
boxes.  The curtained door before you is now so small you can barely see it!  
You are so large that you are squished to either side!  Oh my how will you
escape!
