Entrance to Looney Tunes Land~
You are heading along a small path lined with white stones toward a grassy
field. This field seems to extend in all directions as far as you can see.
It looks strangely two-dimensional. You hear the strains of "The Merry-Go-
Round broke down" playing somewhere...

A Grassy Field~
You are walking across a wide, grassy field. To the north you imagine you
can see a farmhouse, while a large stadium looms in the distance to the
south. To the west a dark and thick forest starts abruptly.

Approaching the Farmhouse~
You are heading along an even path toward a red farmhouse that looks as if it
has been painted onto the sky, which resembles a sheet of blue paper with
blobs of white paint on it.

Approaching the Stadium~
The walls of the stadium lie to the south of here. They are plastered with
a variety of posters. From here, you cannot see any way of entering the
stadium. However, there is a small hole in the ground near an old oak
tree to the left of the path.

A Thick Forest~
This forest is rather forbidding, though some of its impact is lessened by
the fact that it feels as if you are walking past sheets of paper with
drawings of trees on them. No matter which way you walk, the trees converge
to one side of you, never in front, or behind, or around you. You can't seem
to get amongst them. There are posters stuck on some of the trees.

The Farmyard~
You are walking through the farmyard. You hear strains of square dance music
coming from somewhere. Strangely two-dimensional animals stand about,
remaining unnaturally motionless. Come to think of it, you haven't seen
ANYTHING move here.

You are in a long narrow underground passage, obviously the home of some

next to old Billie Holliday 78s and a pile of old newspapers. There is also

lies a park.

saw earlier; it is about the same height as this apartment. A rather odd
cat appears to be doing something whilst perched atop it. Wonder what he's
up to...? You can head across a tightrope wire he has affixed to here if
you want.

a yard full of savage dogs down below...
