Paved road~
The cobblestones of this road are worn flat with years of use, though now it is
oddly quiet.  In fact, it appears noone has been here for quite some time.  
West of here are the gates of a mighty city, while the road thins to a dirt
path to the east which leads off into the plains.

Paved road~
Once upon a time there was a busy market here which specialized in food, drink,
and souvenirs for adventurers travelling to and from the city.  Now all that
remains are a few overturned stalls and some smashed up trinkets.  Anything of
any value to anyone has long since been removed.  Not far west of here the city
gates loom omenously, while the road continues to the east into the plains.

Paved road~
From here it is evident that all is not well inside the city.  The walls, once
constructed of smooth grey stone are charred black as though they had been
exposed to some sort of immense heat.  The proud city gates which once would
have held thousands of defenders at bay have been twisted and mangled into
useless lumps of metal.  The pavement here is scorched too, and further west it
appears to have been blasted apart altogether in places.  East is beginning to
look to be the safer way to go.

East gate of Midgard~
Here is what is left of the once proud east gate of Midgard.  Once the home of
many an adventurer, the city was all but destroyed by a bunch of rogue wizards.
After putting paid to the city's defenders, they ransacked and destroyed
everything they could, while leaving just enough of the city standing to be
recognizable as a lesson to any who would cross them in the future.  The gods
were quick to bring down harsh retribution upon the heads of these wizards, but
by that time, the damage had been done.  As punishment, the wizards were
stripped of their powers and made to construct the city of Haven, where most
adventurers live today.

Main street~
Once a beautiful street, main street has been reduced to mere rubble, except
for the shell of a shop to the north.  Guards used to be able to climb the city
gates here to defend the city, now the stairs lie at your feet, more twisted
metal.  West of here is a crater which used to be a waterway passing through
the city.  The bridge has been destroyed, but that doesn't matter because no
water will ever pass this way again.

Treasure shop~
Smashed cabinets and some fragments of colored rock remain as a reminder that
this was once a busy treasure shop.  The bones of the proprietor have been
kicked into a corner, one of the last unsavory acts of the people who ransacked
this place.  The only exit is back south to main street.

Midgard creek~
Before the destruction of Midgard, this creek used to flow from the river to
the south to the power station north of here.  It drove a complicated turbine
system which supplied running hot water to the residents of Midgard.  Now, its
just a dried up bed.  North of here is the remains of the turbine, while
south the creek bed joins with the old Midgard river.  Main street continues
east and west.

Further up the creek.~
The creek bed here passes between what looks like the back of a small house to
the west, and the side of the now deserted treasure shop to the east.  There is
a private jetty to the west which would have been accessible when the creek was
full, but now it is much too high up to reach.  From here you can see that
surprisingly, the turbine is still active, something keeps its blades turning
in a futile attempt to plough through water that isn't there.  North is the
heart of the turbine and south the creek continues back towards the river.

Heart of the turbine.~
Up the creek without a paddle you might say.  The last thing you have time to
wonder before one of the blades of the turbine crashes into the side of your
head is, what possessed you to wander into a still functioning turbine anyway?
Unfortunately, the blade ended it for you before you were able to puzzle out
the answer.

Midgard river~
Nothing but a dried up river bed is left to indicate that this was once the
centre of the mighty Midgard river, which separated the two halves of the city
of Midgard.  There are skeletons of a few dead animals scattered here and
there, a tribute to the awesome power used by the wizards to destroy this
place.  North of here a creek bed stretches out towards what might once have
been a turbine, while east and west the river bed continues.

End of the river bed~
The river comes to an abrupt halt here as it meets the city wall.  Once upon a
time there was a grate which allowed adventurers to travel out of Midgard into
the outside world.  Now it is so clogged with debris, that there is no hope of
even opening it, let alone actually getting through, which means the only way
to go from here is back west along the river bed.

More creek~
Nothing here of interest, just more of the same dry creek bed and skeletons of
small things which used to live in the creek before it was destroyed.  South of
here is the river, while north is where there used to be a bridge across the
creek.

Main street~
This part of main street was never very interesting, its main feature being the
Midgard docks to the south.  Main street, or what's left of it, continues west
towards a market place and east into the creek where once there used to be a
bridge.

Midgard docks~
A few pieces of splintered wood here attest to the fact that this was once the
mighty dock of Midgard.  In the past, many great ships travelled from this dock
to other lands.  Now there's not even any water around.  The bones of a seagull
are the sad remains of a busy water thoroughfare.

River by the docks~
Here is where the river passes under the docks.  In days of old, many ships
docked here to take adventurers to distant lands.  Now there is nothing but a
dried river bed and some scraps of wood which doubtless have fallen from the
docks above.  The river continues east and west while the remnants of the docks
lie north.

Market square~
What a mess!  This was obviously the centre of one of the major battles since
everything that could possibly identify it as a market has been destroyed.  
Still, this is market square, which was the hub of activity on the north side
of Midgard before its destruction.  Main street runs east and west from here,
to the north is temple square and the ruins of the great temple of Midgard,
while to the south is the square of commoners.

Here, Main street passes between the Midgard armory and weaponsmith.  Once

lie abandoned to the elements.  Main street continues west towards the city

Midgard weaponry~
Rows upon rows of the finest weapons used to line these walls.  Now there are
scattered broken weapons on the floor, useless to anyone, and the walls are
lined with dust and cobwebs.  Strangely though, a presence still seems to
inhabit this store.

Midgard Armory~
Scattered around the room are the remnents of what was once a vast supply of
armor.  Oddly though, some of it seems to have survived, along with the essence
of the original Midgard armorer who would be only too happy to sell you some.

Half way up the cliff~
You have made it half way up the sheer cliff which makes up the north side of
the Eliqua River.  Looking down you can see a sandy inlet, and upwards you
think you spy a castle purched atop the cliff.  The higher you climb, the more
the sense of impending danger increases.  You continue to feel that icy chill,
is it wind?  Or something more sinister?

Top of the cliff~
You have reached the top of the cliff, and you were right about the castle.  
An omenous structure, it casts an enormous shadow across the bare clifftop.  
The icy feeling you have been feeling ever since arriving on this side of the
river has increased, you are chilled to the bone.  You've come this far though,
you might as well see it through.

Before the castle~
Standing before the castle you can't help but be impressed with its sheer size
and stature.  The walls are smooth and unclimbable, and the battlements at the
top give the castle's defenders ample opportunity to pick off anyone who thinks
it might be worthwhile trying.  It appears the only way in is through the
portcullus which you are currently standing before.  On either side of the
entrance are two massive hollow pillars inside which the gateguards can shelter
from the cold, or from the light?

The spam pit~
So this is where all that unwanted mail goes.  Because of the number of
complaints they received from users, the staff of the cyberspace post office
decided to take a more active role in combatting unwanted mail.  The spam pit
is where they dump all the get rich quick schemes, pyramid marketting offers,
and other questionable material that certain cyberspace unsavories insist on
trying to pedal.  This is not a place to linger, you begin to feel
clostrophobic as the spam litterally clammers to be read

You really don't like this area, you're sure if you stay around for too long

The wall of web to the north continues here, but you still seem to be able to
travel in other directions.  One thin strand stretches from the wall out to the
north, to a structure which is similar to the web you are in, only surrounded
by flames.  Also, some of the pulses in that web seem to be travelling
backwards.  You have an unexplainable desire to hack the joining strand loose,
and you realize, that web must be AOL!  Eek, get it away!
