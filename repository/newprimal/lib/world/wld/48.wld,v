The Woods~
You are wandering in a strange forest where you can hear a magical 
entrancing musical tune that sounds like it is being played on wind pipes.  
This music makes you want to find the person or creature who is playing it
so you can follow them devotedly. The small narrow path leading through 
the woods heads east and south from here.
