Clearing 21~
The path leads you northward, and gradually upward. The ground around
you is somewhat drier now, and the swamp trees have been replaced by
deep forest. The trees thin out ahead of you, and you see a large
clearing dotted with low bushes.

Swamp path~
You hear lots of howling noises from here. Then you realize you are
being watched by a few wolves. You look around, but you see nothing.
You hold your fear in and continue your journey.

Suddenly, you are out of the swampy path and on a path that is made of
bricks. You see a large fountain to your west and the brick path continues
eastward. You continue your journey.

You are standing outside of the berry garden. The gate in front of

that a less seasoned traveller would call adventures. To you, fighting
Orcs and Goblins, defying evil wizards, and slaying giant wolves are
all in a day's work.
