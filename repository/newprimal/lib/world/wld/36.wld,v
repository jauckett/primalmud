Haven latrines~
This place stinks!
This is where the people of Haven come to relieve themselves.
From here, you could enter the sewers if you were that way inclined, 
but who knows what sort of creature would live in a place like that,
and besides, it stinks even worse down there than it does here.
There's some graffiti on the wall here, and an escape from the stench to the south.

graffiti~
There are some particularly unpleasant things written about some of the gods which you feel embarrassed just reading.
Why someone would write something like that about the benevalent Gods of Primal is a mystery.
Scratched particularly deeply into one wall is the phrase
"For a good time, Call Gamina!"

In the sewer beneath Southbank and Main~
   You are in the sewer junction below Main Street and Southbank Road.  Here
the sewage travelling from the east joins the sewage travelling from the west
creating a faster flowing creek of sewage to the south.

   Lined with algie the walls are constructed well, and have been here for
hundreds of years.  The algie is slowly eating away at the mortar, weakening
the structure.  A small trickle of sewage flows from the west to the east.

the surrounding plant life.  There are reeds surrounding and in the swamp.  
Huge green willow trees are spotted throughout the banks, and a number of
smaller bushes lie between these.  This swamp is secluded from everything and
supports a large variety of wildlife.  You can travel north back into the
tunnel or explore the swamp to the East, West or South.

This dark smelly sewer nearly makes you bring up your last meal. There are rats scampering around feeding off the vile on the walls
d29 2

You are before the crap catcher, catching all the crap that is put down the toilets in Haven
d44 1

d50 3
a52 1
You nearly pass out from the lack of oxygen as the faint green mist of gas surrounds you. You can hardly see your hands and wonder what the hell lies down here!
d66 3
a68 1
You are in the sewer junction below Main Street and Southbank Road. Here the sewage travelling from the east joins the sewage travelling from the west creating a faster flowing creek of sewage to the south.
d90 3
a92 2
Lined with algie the walls are constructed well, and have been here for hundreds of years. The algie is slowly eating away at the mortar, weakening the structure.
A small trickle of sewage flows from the east to the west.
d106 3
a108 1
A trickle of sewage outlined with algie is here, joining the main sewage tunnel. You can travel east and west or head up into the slightly smaller sewage tunnel.
d127 4
a130 2
The smell here is pretty bad and you wonder what has died down here lately. You can travel east back along the main tunnel where it doesn't smell so bad.
You realise you are in a rat nest which is located under a pile of god knows what to the east, piled against the sewer wall.
d140 2
a141 1
The algie here tends to cover the walls and floor, suggesting putrid sewage flowing from the east
d155 3
a157 1
There is a very slight trickle of sewage here, yet the algie is growing 1 foot each side of the flow of sewage. There must be a daily flushing from the above business'.
d171 3
a173 1
A pile of steaming shit lies here emitting gasses. The algie in this section of the tunnel is out of control, what the hell are people eating above!
d184 2

The sewage here flows from north to south. The smell is starting to be overpowering
d199 2
a200 1
The sewage flows from north to south and a sulphur stench fills your nostrels
d214 2

d327 2
a328 1
The trickle of sewage flows from the west to the east. You should breathe through your mouth as to avoid the stench!
d342 3
a344 1
Flowing from your east, the small trickle of sewage allows algie to grow on the base of the tunnel, making it slippery to walk on. The slope down from here into the main tunnel does not help you at all!

The liquid forms a slight trickle sound as it falls down the ledge. North of you is a continuation of a slightly smaller sewer tunnel
d461 2
a462 1
A small amount of liquid moves along the base of the sewer. You can head slightly up north or head slightly down south
d476 2
a477 1
Surrounded by liquid shit, the gas given off by this is forcing up the oxygen making it terribly hard to breathe.

You have reached what looks like the highest point in the sewer system, leading up into a limestone tunnel
d502 1

Seemingly carved through the limestone, this tunnel has long been abondoned
d516 2
a517 1
A strange place you have stumbled into, seemingly what you think is an old exit out of the sewers may turn out to be something else indeed
d531 2
a532 1
Light appears from the corner to the east, suggesting you have reached some kind of cavern
d546 2
a547 1
The light here seems to be comming from somewhere above. The limestone walls are polished as if this was once a special place

You are before the ancient ruins of Haven. This was once used as a main travelling point to the outer world, yet over time technology knowledge increased, creating new possibilities unseen to the locals. 
They began to realise that hiding their technology from others did not benefit them in the end and built new transporters in the actual city.

Limestone walls line this cavern that would be very old, perhaps manually dug out by the ancestors of the people of Haven.

You are in the swamp of Haven where the water run off fills this low lying land. The treated sewage empties out here, giving all year round nutrients to the surrounding plant life.
There are reeds surrounding and in the swamp. Huge green willow trees are spotted throughout the banks, and a number of smaller bushes lie between these.
This swamp is secluded from everything and supports a large variety of wildlife.
You can travel north back into the tunnel or explore the swamp to the East, West or South.
