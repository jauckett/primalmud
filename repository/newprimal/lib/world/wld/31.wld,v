The battle arena~
This room has the distinct smell of blood.  Weapons of a variety
of descriptions line the walls on racks and hooks.  Other fighting
implements line the walls including armour and spiked boots.
Standing in the middle of the arena you see a heavily armoured 
knight with a very big sword.  As you enter he glares at you.
He raises his finger, pointing at you and says "You won't last 
1 minute against me!!!".
