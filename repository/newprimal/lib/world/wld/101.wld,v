Forbidden Docks~
Rather plain docks made of mouldy timber provide entrance onto this fabled 
island fortress. The state of the docks seems to imply a discouragement of
visitors to the land. The native islanders already approach in the
distance, wielding sharp weapons and items of power.

A small heavily fortified town lies at the base of a cliff, upon which

Forbidden Docks~
The timbers in this section of the docks are even worse, and blood lies in 
thick pools where it has not been absorbed yet, or fallen through the gaps
into the sea beneath. Peering downward you can make out shark fins
circling.

Forbidden Dock Steps~
Rickety wooden steps lead down to a rocky pathway that leads into the 
fortified town, and back up to the relative safety of the docks. There is
an almost unnatural hush in the area, a suspicious lull like the calm
before a storm.

Under the Forbidden Docks~
The sea here is infested with sharks waiting for food scraps to fall from 
the docks above. They look quite lazy and slow, obviously used to
frequent easy meals. From the small number of fishing boats you have
spotted so far, you deduce that their meals aren't strictly kept to ocean
faring creatures.

Deserted Beach~
Littered across the span of this small beach are remnants of warships and 
dragoons. From the tall masted to strangely shaped, they have all fallen
prey to the denizens of this island, driven into the sand and their crews
slaughtered.

Many different types of ships are rotting slowly here, abused by the ocean

Forbidden Gates~
Not very tall, the gates stand open on hinges long rusted in place. You 
wonder at the sort of town that feels safe enough to leave itself so open
to invading forces. Tall observation towers thrust into the sky, small 
flickering lights can occasionally be seen sparking briefly. To the east 
lies a town that is drab, with buildings flat rooved and square walled.

The compound~
You are in a square area defined by houses facing away into unknown streets. 
The only two pathways from this killing ground lie on opposite ends, and
the reason for the deceptively open gate becomes apparent.

A large square area, the ground is bloodied and stained, and metallic objects

fighters using their fingers in desperate attempts to escape.

An orderly street devoid of filth and solidly built leads east into the 
centre of the town. The street is wide and in normal times could easily
be mistaken for belonging in your home town of Haven. The houses have
large windows and decorated doorways, showing a craftmanship high in  
quality and aesthetic taste. Sounds of children laughing can be heard as
life continues normally behind the relative safety of the town's
safeguards, beneath the watchful eye of the Tower on top of the cliff to
the east, and protected by the mountains around it.

into the cliff. A table sits in the middle of the room, that could easily
seat twenty warriors in comfort, and at the head an almost throne like

Stabilised quite nicely, you admire the intricate work on the walls of the
tower, realising that this is the only place that it has been visible to your
eye. More of immediate interest is the shimmering green portal flickering 
in the middle of the room, surrounded by the tell-tale stabilising poles.

Standing at the top of the marble stairs you stare down into the darkness
into which they descend. To the north you can make out two huge pillars
standing before a large tower that reaches high into the sky, and the
four strange arms that extend outward, at the summit. The cliff continues
upward around you, making navigation in any other direction impossible.

The Twin Pillars of Kana~
Almost pencil thin, the two pillars stand on either side of the path that

from them. Considering the town beneath you, protecting the passage up
here, you strongly suspect this to be some last elaborate trap.

Tower Entrance~
Looking up you see the grey stone of the tower absorbing what light there
is, hoarding it into itself. You realise that the arms outstretched at the
summit are not hands open in supplication, but are instead reaching out
to grab some unknown. Directly in front of you there is a tube that leads
up to the tower, and, presumably, the interior of the structure.

Standing underneath the portcullis you see that it has long since rusted

their magical defences, then a few bits of iron would be no match for
them. The tower itself lies open before you, to the north through a short 
corridor.

You stand inside the tower. Or do you? You cannot see any walls, any

portcullis is vanished, and you now seem to be standing on ... nothing.
Your feet are slightly above the soil beneath you, however. Whatever it
is that you are standing on, it seems to be invisible! You look around and
spot figures moving about, some of them so high up it seems to make your 
neck ache. You are in the tower, after all, but navigating in this
building made of nothing will be challenging.

substance gooey wall~
You look closely at the east wall, and while you can't actually touch the
substance, it seems to be at least a foot away from your hand, you are
fairly sure that it's what comes out of the rough end of a seagull! This
room must be in the eastern area of the tower, near the mountains,
and whatever magic keeps this building up, must also give it a regular
wash. But it missed a spot.

A soft purple portal shimmers politely in the centre of the room, surrounded
by four poles which seem to be required to make anything stable in this

distortion up here seems to have gone wrong and merged the two desks into
each other creating an ugly hybrid that is lopsided and almost sad to

Portal Room on Level 5~
Darkness seeps out from the centre of this room. You can just make out
the source of it, a dark portal in the middle leaking evil energy. You
sense that it is only now beginning to gain momentum, and once this tower
has been consumed, whatever force these mages have unleashed on the world
will expand outward, forever consuming, until there is nothing left.

Dark Portal~
Standing on the roof of the tower, no wind disturbs you despite the
incredible height. You suspect that the view would be magnificent, but
darkness lies like a blanket over the tower, smothering it. Through your
own arts you are able to penetrate the gloom and spot four short bridges  
leading north, south, east and west toward platforms that stand in front
of the arms you saw on the tower.
A dark portal is in the centre of the roof.

Surrounded by eternity, and stars beyond counting, you stand upon a

thousands of small suns. The universe unfolds around you, and secrets
untold beg to be discovered, as they whisper their names to you, tempting
you. Here lies the centre of what the masters of the tower had hoped to
reach with their meddling. 
And here they met their match.

Peering through the slits you can make out the compound you came through 
before entering this cursed maze. The gate still stands open, and to the
east you can spot the docks.

This large table holds many tactical maps, and a detailed layout of the
town of Kana, with notes joted down in critical areas.

tactical notes maps~
You peer at the maps, and spot a particularly interesting item that
outlines the use of underground cache rooms in the outer maze. Apparently
these are traps to fool invaders, by containing treasure, as well as
poisoned food.
