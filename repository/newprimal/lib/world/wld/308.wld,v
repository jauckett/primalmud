An underground cavern~
You are in a very large underground cavern, the ceiling being so high you can't
see it.  Anything could be living up there such as thousands of vampire bats!
The cavern echos when you take a step, suggesting it is larger then you think.

Above the stream~
There is a magnificent embedded shape of a dragon on the wall. It is made of gold and outlined in silver. There are two purple rubies embedded in its eyes. You wonder if you should enter or move on...
This door is radiating a very warm, yet strange purple aura.

Death Dragon Lair~
   You have entered the Death Dragon's Lair.  The walls, ceiling and floor are
all lined with the same dragon imprinting as the door.  There is 1 for each
wall, centered perfectly, and the purple rubies seem to be staring at you, with
red protrudin iris'.  This could be a bad idea!

   You are standing infront of the Death Dragon's Nest.  It is made of a
strange purple-glowing material you have never seen before.  It raises itself
1m off the floor and is perfecly suited to fit the Death Dragon.

Strange portal room~
   You have arrived in the aqua-blue portal room.  It looks exactly like the
hallway you were in as you entered the castle...  But it seems to have been cut
off to the south, forcing the alternate route through the cave.

Underwater in the blue liquid.~
   You notice what seems to be the top section of a steel ladder attached to
the wall.  This must have been flooded quite a long time ago.  You can barely
see much further then your feet as you swim.  Hopefully there is nothing living
down here!

A very wet hallway~
   You are in what seems to be a continuation of the hallway, but this is above
the water level.  There is a broken drain pipe a few metres above your head,
dripping water into the water below.  The darkness seems to have gone and there
is light comming from around the corner ahead.  Where is this taking you and
what is at the end?

A slightly damp hallway~
   You are walking down what you think is a continuation of the previous
hallway.  As you approach the corner, it is starting to look like there is
finally an exit out of here.  You sense the air is moving toward you and then
back out ahead of you.

Centre of the temple~
   You are swimming in the water surrounding the statue in the centre of the
room.  This is a magnificent place to relax as there is no ceiling above you,
allowing the outer elements in creating life in the fountain water.  Below you
notice that this pond is rather deep, you seem unable to penetrate the water
any further, as if you are standing on some invisble force field under the
surface.

into your brain.  Either way your very dead..  Too bad you have no sense!

amazing.  You feel you could dive into the lake and although you will get wet,
you feel is it safe to do so.  To the West there are two strange circles in the
wall.  The stalagtights a few meters above your head look quite sharp!...  
Make sure you don't bang your head!

suggesting death is close to you.  This castle has been here for many centuries
as weather erosion is showing.  The moss and algie covered blocks of marble
confirm this.  You wonder weather you should simply remove the ring you were
given to get you the hell out of here or press on and find out what lives
inside here.

Beneath the surface of the stream~
   You are swimming beneath the surface of the stream.  There is a slight pull
of the current to the south.  Upon close inspection you notice a small opening
in the wall to the south....  Yet it is far too small for you to fit through.

A tunnel~
   You have managed to get up into this ancient tunnel hidden behind a large
rock that rolled back into place as you passed through.  It created the
illusion that it doesn't exist.  It is quite dry, yet very very dark.  Do you
think you should investigate deeper, or go for a swim again?

You have entered the Death Dragon's Lair. The walls, ceiling and floor are all lined with the same dragon imprinting as the door.
There is 1 for each wall, centered perfectly, and the purple rubies seem to be staring at you, with red protrudin iris'. This could be a bad idea!

You are swimming in the water surrounding the statue in the centre of the room. This is a magnificent place to relax as there is no ceiling above you, allowing the outer elements in creating life in the fountain water.

*** free room ***~
You are in a very large underground cavern, the ceiling being so high you can't see it. Anything could be living up there such as thousands of vampire bats! The cavern echos when you take a step, suggesting it is larger then you think.

A narrow forest trail~
Join this room to room 1902 - mountain area!
As you fight your way through the dense overgrowth taking you deeper into the forest, you realise that perhaps it has remained unused to allow such dense overgrowth for a good reason!

The forest reveals a magnificent structure, known in legend as the Great Death Castle. Hidden by the forest your lucky to even find it amoungst all the over growth of trees and vines.
The Castle is HUGE, built of a strange blue marble it glistens in the sun light of the day and becomes virtually invisible in the darkness of the night. There seems to be no clear entrance to the Caslte other then requesting it!

Idle Lamers' Room~
You're standing in a room purposely built for idlers like you.
Here you can idle to your heart's content without
