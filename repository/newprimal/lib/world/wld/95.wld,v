Before the Entrance of Shadow Keep~
You are walking along a rough that leads straight up to the Shadow Keep.
Through the trees, you can faintly make out the dark outlined of the huge
tower. Its huge shape made it superior to its tiny surroundings. To the north
you can see the entrance of the keep. To the south is the thick forest.

Entrance to Shadow Keep~
You walk up in front of the keep. You look up and see that the keep is huge,
extending far into the sky with many towers. The huge shadow cast by the
keep seems to engulf its own surrounding, making the surrounding shimmering
with a bitter sense of evilness. There is a huge stone blocking your only way
into the keep. To the south lies the path back into the thick of the forest.

Inside the Shadow Keep~
You are now inside the Shadow Keep. The view inside is truely amazing.
It seems that the interior is much more bigger than what you have expected.
The keep seems civilised, as compared to what the legend has told, place
for the undead. But somehow, you sense the evil among the air. There are exits
in all direction. To the north you can see a brightly lit hall. East and west
is the guard house. You try going south but find the door has tightly shut.

Guard House~
You are inside a guard house, or used-to-be one. There is nothing much left
in here except for some broken furnitures and some rusty old weapons that
are still lying around the messy place. There is a small window to the south,
probably for the lookout who is on duty. As you strain your eyes towards the
darkness, you seems to notice something moves. The only way out is through
the way you came in.

You walk into the main hall of the keep. Paintings of the ancient god decorates
the four stone walls. On each side of the wall, there are three girandole with
four large candles burning on it. A huge chandelier hanging from the high
ceiling add brightness to the hall. A few servants are here cleaning the hall.
There are exits in all directions. To the north you can see a great statue
standing. South leads you back to the entrance. It is too dark to the east and
the west brings you into a beautiful room.

Before the Great Statue~
Before you stood a large statue --- the Great Statue of Vashnaka. Vashnaka was
once a great priest who studied the way of art. But his greed brought forward
the power of darkness and soon consumed him among the evil beings of the 
underworld. He was lost from the world since then and no news of his 
whereabout was known to anyone. Never have you expect to see his statue 
in the Shadow Keep. To the east is a messy room. To the north you can see 
a dimly lit room with carpets. To the south is the large hall. It is too 
dark to see to the west.
