Lair of Troglodyte knight.~
This room in the long and endless spiralling tunnel is guarded by a 
vicious Troglodyte knight. He will never let you pass without a fight.
At his feet you see piles of bones mixed in with the slime and the filth.
On the walls are numerous weapons of all shapes and sizes and you wonder if

THE PIT!~
You weren't cautious enough.
The hideous beast that is at the end of this spiralling tunnel is
so undescribable. It has spent so long dwelling in the darkness of this
pit that it no longer has arms, legs or eyes. It is just a mass of green 
slime with the biggest mouth you have ever seen. AND my god is it hungry.
This will surely be certain death, as there seems to be no escape. Maybe if 
you look carefully you could get out, but then again maybe not.
