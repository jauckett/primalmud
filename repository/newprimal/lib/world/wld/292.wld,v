As you head further into the tunnell the noises you could hear earlier begin to get a little louder they sound like running machinery but the park is abandoned
so you didn't think would be possible

Just past the ferris wheel~
You have just walked past the old ferris wheel and as you look back you think you see a person standing on top of the ferris wheel but upon taking a second look they seem to have dissapeared. Off in the distance to the east you can see 
what looks like some small train tracks

Entry to the dogem cars~
You are here at every bodies favorite the dogem cars but what is more frightening is that you can hear noises coming from within the small building that house these cars and are having second thought about entering the building.
As you try to look through the door way you realise that it is pitch black inside and unless you can see in the dark you will have no chance.

Maybe this is where all those people who worked here years ago drowned with the great flood that occured.

In front of a door~
The door to your west leads to the old park managers office and it
is rumored that he was the only one who was never found when the 
floods hit , he had no chance of getting out,.
It's said that the reason they never found his corpse was that it
was eaten by the rats that lurk around down here.

The office~
The master controllers office is where the head controller ran the park from but it hasn't been used for years and years.
There are clumps of solid pulp all over the place in here and the old desk sitting in the corner has rotted away to almost the metal frame that supported the timber overlays.

Middle of the platform~
This is the exact centre of the platform and is the most likely spot to get a reasonable seat on the rolloer caoster when it pulls up. Unless of course you prefer to be at the front

In a dark corner of the tunnel~
You are standing in a very dark area of the tunnel and with all the twisting and turning that has taken place you aren't even sure about where you have come from or where your even headed to.As you listen you can hear a muffled sound on the other side of a door which leads off to the west but are nt sure if you even want to know what it is you can hear.

Inside the dogem cars~
You have entered the Track of the dogem cars and all seems to be very quiet...
You are unsure about this place as you feel like you are being drained of energy. It is very cold in here and you wish that there was some form of heating
