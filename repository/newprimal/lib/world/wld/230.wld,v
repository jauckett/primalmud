TMA-1~
You are at the bottom of a large excavation which was done decades ago
to unearth an alien artifact known as TMA-1. To this day no one
really knows its purpose. Many large solar lamps light the bottom
of this excavation. The pit is about 40 feet deep and about 100 feet wide.

You are walking and bounding along on the surface of the moon.
You are following tracks made by moon buggies so as not to
get lost.

Moon surface.~
The track continues to the east and west. In the distance to
the east there appears to be a large excavation site.
There are several heavy pieces of machinery on the
surface.
To the west the tracks wind and twist around the moon.

Looking over TMA-1 excavation.~
You are standing at the top of a ladder which leads down into the
TMA-1 excavation. The solar lamps lighting the pit give off an
strange glow.

The tracks end here at a sharp cliff. There are also many moon rocks
lying on the ground, some looking semi-precious.
The only way out is to the east.

The tracks that run east from here lead towards what appears to be
a large crater. Or is it a site where the people of Luna City mine.
To the south there is a junction in the tracks.
