Death Dragon~
Death Dragon~
Sitting here on her nest with her strange red eyes outlined in a deep purple, this Death Dragon spreads her wings out in a defensive manner, leans forward slightly and opens her mouth...RUN!!!
~
She is lined with thick purple armour scales and wings spread out as if she is about to cook you for dinner. Her tail has a HUGE raser sharp anchor shaped end, so sharp that it could slice off your head with one strike.
Her teeth and claws are a very shiny purple, so shiny they reflect light. They look very very sharp, and you would hate to cop a slash or bite.

It has a serpent like tail and is covered in a greenish looking armour of stone.
