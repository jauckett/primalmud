Sylvester is determined to feast upon Tweety Pie, and will not brook any
interference from you. You'd be best to leave him to it- with his ineptitude
and bad luck, he will damage himself far more than you ever could.

Tweety Pie is a sweet little bird with an adoring owner. However his life
is constantly threatened by hungry cats such as Sylvester. Actually, that
isn't true- Sylvester is so incompetent that Tweety has never been in any
real danger of being eaten.
