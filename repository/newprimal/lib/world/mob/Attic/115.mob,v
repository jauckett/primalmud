A shadow warrior guards the gate
~
Angered at the gods for stripping their still living brethren of their powers
and turning them into common slaves, the wizards who had been killed during the
war banded together in the underworld to unleash a deadly army of warriors into
the world of the living.  Being unable to influence an area much beyond the
central focus of their power, they instead elected to guard midgard to insure
that no mortal would ever live there again.  To this end, the shadow warriors
were created.  All but insubstantial, there presence in this world causes a
major temporal rift.  It is said that anyone who touches a shadow warrior will
be sucked immediately, along with them, back into the underworld.  However,
either noone has tried this, or they have and they haven't come back to tell of
it, because there are no recorded cases
of it ever happening.

A 6 foot high, hideously ugly mutant rat.

Some freak of magic has allowed this rat to grow disproportionately large,
while surviving seemingly without food.  Or maybe it lives off hapless
adventurers who wander into Midgard.

Weaponsmith~
the Midgard Weaponsmith~
the ghost of the Midgard Weaponsmith is still selling weapons.
~
This storekeeper has never been able to accept the distruction of Midgard for
what it is, and he continues to sell weapons in denial of the truth.  He's even
found a way to project himself back into the world of the living so he can sell
there as well as in the afterlife, and by the looks of his clothes and the good
condition of his ghostly body, the trade must be pretty good.
