Foreign Tourist~
the Foreign Tourist~
A Foreign Tourist stands here.
~
Wearing a backpack and comfortable shoes, the tourist stands out
a mile away.  Looking at you, he looks very nervous and he must feel 
out of place.  It must be that stupid, 'Welcome to Hollywood' T-Shirt.

Tough Soprano Guard Bastard~
Soprano Security Guard~
A Soprano Security Guard stands here.
~
The Soprano Security Guard looks as though he has been in a fair-few
fights throughout his time.  He looks mean and very intimidating, hired to
protect all the rich and famous in Hollywood.  One thing is for sure, if you want
a hard battle... This guy will give you one!

As tough-a-prick that you will find, this guard has been
training to be a police officer for years, but due to his lack
of intelligence, has had to settle with being head of the security

suit and is wearing dark sunglasses.

After finishing his extremely successful show, Jerry is now contemplating
a career in feature films.  He is fairly casually dressed, wearing a nice pair of

basis of his comedy.
