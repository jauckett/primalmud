A Tuskan Raider is standing here, preparing to attack.
~
The Tuskan Raider, or sand person, is dressed in a strange brown
cloak. It seems to have its head rapped in some sort of cloth with 
small lens' sticking out for it to see through. These things roam the
desert attacking unsuspecting travellers, stealing their belonging, 
and leaning them for dead in the desert.
