Myrddraal eyeless halfmen shadowmen lurks fades~
the Myrddraal, commanders of the Trollocs~
A Myrddraal stands staring eyelessly here.
~
The Myrddraal stares at you, running a shiver down your spine as you realise
that a smooth surface replaced where should have been the eye sockets. They are
twisted offspring of Trollocs in which the human stock used to create trollocs
has resurfaced. Physically they are like men except they bear no eyes, but can
see like eagles in light or dark. They have certain powers of the Dark One
including the ability to cause paralyzing fear with a look and the ability to
vanish wherever there are shadows.

the Greenman~
A huge pile of foliage sits on the hill here.
~
At a standing position, the Greenman stands 3 times taller than an average
human. The whole content of his body is made of foliage and twigs, he looks
at you with huge hazelnut eyes. The Greenman is gentle to and by nature.
