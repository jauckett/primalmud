penguin tux linux~
Tux~
Tux, the penguin, is squatting here.
~
   Such an adorable penguin rests before you.  His bright white chest and dark
outer proving useful for camouflage in these icy lands.  While he looks cute
and fuzzy, you can't help but wonder how much of a bite he can pack.

pike fish~
a pike fish~
A pike fish swims about, looking for a meal.
~
   It looks unfinished.  Take a long piece of strong muscle, add powerful teeth
to one end, give it a big appetite and a mean disposition and you have pike.  
They detest all living things, including themselves.  If something goes near it
and they can get it in their mouth they will eat it.

bsd daemon devil~
the daemon~
A daemon stands here, his pitchfork raised.
~
   Flames flicker from the skin of this daemon as hair would grow on a man,
it's sturdy pitchfork raised, as it prepares for attack.  Now would probably be
a good time to make a fast exit.

An abominable snowman stands here, ready to attack.

   The creature before you looks like a cross between an ape and a man.  At

piss off!

white wolf~
the white wolf~
A white wolf faces you, poised for attack.
~
   This wolf looks as though it's been adapted for arctic conditions, its thick
coat of white fur proving a good camouflage in the snow, it's hardened claws
enabling it to grip the slippery ground a little better.  And it's sharp teeth,
well they're for chewing on lumps of meat, like yourself.
