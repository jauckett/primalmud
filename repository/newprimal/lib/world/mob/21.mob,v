cook fairy~
Fairy Cook~
A stout fairy waddles around the kitchen cooking.
~
A stout fairy has flour covering her arms up to her elbows and is humming
a merry tune. You doubt whether the delicate wings on her back could support
her weight. She's the first fairy you've seen who isn't slender. Obviously this
cook likes to sample her own cooking just a bit too much.

catepillar giant~
Giant Catepillar~
A giant catepillar is munching on a giant leaf. This is one catepillar you don't want to try squashing underfoot.
~
Three foot high and fifteen foot long this catepillar looks like it could eat
you in two or three gulps. Thorny bristles covering its length are several
inches long and very sharp. Get too close and you risk impaling yourself
on them. Luckily the beast appears more interested in eating its meal then
acquiring you as its next one.

fairy mage~
A old slender fairy with silver hair looks at you with eyes sharp as a hawks.
~
For as long as the fairies have existed their queens have had mages to advise
them and help protect them and their subjects from harm. At any time anywhere
from 5 to 20 mages used to belong to the queens court, but the Magus was the only
one left alive after the enfans attacked the fairies. The livid scar running down the
left side of his face marring his otherwise almost feminine features are a stark 
reminder that he didn't escape untouched by the evil.
