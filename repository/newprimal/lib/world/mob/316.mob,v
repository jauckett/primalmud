~
The most unpopular model of all Deva-Droids creations.  He was the one that
looked like a chewed up rubber end of a pencil.  He wants to turn himself off
to terminate the contract but he has just discovered the thing we call "life"
and he wants MORE

Arnold is standing here trying to talk to Hudzen
~
In a spanky green uniform with a very interesting green hat on his head!  He
has taken it apon himself to tell Hudzen to bog off back to Deva-Droid head
quarters as they don't want him!  He is under the opinion that Hudzen can not
harm any one of them as he is supposed to be programmed NOT to harm humans!

Dave Lister walks around here.

Dave is in his usual attire for when he is on the ship.  Black jacket, black
jeans, grubby t-shirt and a hat.  But in here he carries a bazookoid as they
try to hunt down the polymorph

Arnold J. RIMmer walks around here.
~
Walks is probably the wrong word for Arnold, more like sneaks as he is
completely paranoid about being attacked by the polymorph and is contemplating
on running away aka abandoning ship so he is attacked by the polymorph!

Cat~
The Cat is walking around here.
~
Always dressed to impress!  He is doing an "Olivia" today by wearing a black
headband and some very tight pants!  A snappy jacket that is cut to the waist!
The only difference is he has to wield a bazookoid to try and top the
polymorph!

Kryten~
Kryten walks around here.
~
Kryten, he looks half man and have machine!  The droid that looks like a
novelty condom vending machine!  His designers were really pissed with the
"male species of the world" when she designed Kryten to look like her jilted
lover.

polymorph red dwarf~
the polymorph~
The polymorph stands here.
~
The polymorph a genetically designed fighting machine that went insane and got
sent into deep space.  It was supposed to be the ulitmate fighting machine for
the Americans who designed it but the only problem is they couldn't control it!
So the put it in a capsule and threw it out into deep space!  Now it has
escaped and is roaming around the Loading bay of the Red dwarf!
