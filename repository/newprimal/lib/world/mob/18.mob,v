Xaran the Beholder~
Xaran Beholder~
Xaran the beholder hovers before you.  "Ummm LUNCH" it slobbers.
~
You look at the creature.  It is revolting.  A huge mouth drips with blood
and bits of human flesh cling to its teeth.  It grins at you like you are it's
lunch.  A rime comes to your mind from the past.

One eye to lift and one eye to sleep,
One to charm man and one for beast.
One eye to wound and one eye to slow,
One to bring fear and one to make stone.
One eye makes dust and one eye brings death,
But the last eye kills wizard more than all the rest.

You realize that the last eye is the eye that disrupts magic.
