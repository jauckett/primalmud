A Cyclops is here, trying to judge range with no depth perception.

This Cyclops throws rocks real good.  With one eye though,

Salle woman~
Salle~
A woman ignores you completely, so intent is she upon her sword.
~
   She is a stunning woman, all hair and eyes, it seems.
Her clothing is of the same tawny brown of her skin and
hair.  Her blue eyes look at you appraisingly, seemingly
to show great intelligence.  Her mouth twitches into a 
sneer...

Duwick man~
Duwick~
A truly immense man laughs at you, and draws his knife!
~
   This has to be one of the biggest men you've ever seen.  
He is a full seven feet toe to head, and weighs a good three 
hundred pounds -- mostly on his biceps and pectorals it appears.  
An ornate scabbard slaps by his side, with the pommel of a 
silvered dagger sticking out...a tiny weapon for such a large man!

innkeeper~
the innkeeper~
An aged innkeeper greets you as you enter.
~
   He's old and greying, but seems to have been able to
keep his mental faculties through the years.  A large
woolen sweater is wrapped about him for warmth.  His
blue eyes dance with amusement as he notices your weapons,
but he doesn't seem too terribly startled.

hunter~
the hunter~
A hunter walks through the town streets on his own time.
~
   He looks mean, as if the very personality of the mountains
had infected him with hardness.  His stride is purposeful,
his face weathered, his eyes cold and dark.  Others are
standing out of his way as he walks on by.

A bartender washes a glass idly here.
~
   He nods, smiles, and asks you what you would like to drink.
As you decide, he slowly polishes a glass with an old bar
rag.  The glass is completely clean, but he polishes it anyway.
Go figure.

   He may be a bandit, but he's no slacker.  You wonder

to pull a good guard duty...

   The slave looks up at you with pleading eyes.  He

if you even can.
