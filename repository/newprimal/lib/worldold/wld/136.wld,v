Blue Creek Rd~
You are leaving the long dirt road and entering a semi-built up area.  To your
left you see a large rundown house.  To your south you can see down the
main street of a town.  The whole town looks deserted and weather worn - 
however you sense movement.

Main Bedroom~
You are standing in a large bedroom.  There is a window on the west side 
overlooking the road leading into town.  The curtains are dusty and torn
and the once fine carpet has been bleached by the sun.  The room is cold
and dreary with water damage down the plaster from years of thunderstorms
and a leaky roof.

Hallway~
You are standing in a rundown hallway in the Mayor's Mansion.  Light streams 
though a broken window illuminating a painting of a fine horse.  The hallway 
seems to be deserted but you sense a presence.  The well worn floor boards
creak as you walk towards another doorway in front of you.

Hallway~
You are standing in a short dark corridor.  The walls are covered with 
mold and dirt from years of neglect.  It looks as if no one has  lived here
for a very long time.  You can hear noises coming from the room to the
east. You see a small mouse at the end of the hallway, if you 
LOOK you can see it.

Bedroom~
You are standing in a small bedroom.  This looks to be a child's bedroom with
small toys and a crib in the corner.  There is a mobile covered in cob webs
hanging from the ceiling made from small glass fish.  The room was once a
fine nursery with the walls painted baby blue, but since has faded and
begun to peel.

Blue Creek Rd~
You are walking down a small road towards a small town.  To the east you can
see a large rundown house.  You see something in the window, but when you 
look back it is gone.  The town looks deserted and run down.  Tumbleweed 
catches the wind at blows across your path.

Dining Room~
You are standing in a grand dining room.  The walls are covered with 
expensive pictures and works of art.  The whole room is covered in dust 
and cob webs.  There is fine crockery and silverware placed out on the table 
, a setting that once was polished till it sparkled has not been used.  
The flowers on the center of the table are perfectly dried except for a 
few of the buds that have dislodged themselves and fallen onto the 
tablecloth. The table stretches from one end of the large room to the other.

dinners must have been given here for important people.  The table extends 
far to the north and the south with a expensive unused place setting at
both ends.  You are standing right in front of the large floral arrangement
that has withered away to the point where if you touched it, it would crumble
in your hands.

with no clutter or papers.  There is a large comfortable 
leather chair that has cracked through age and is badly in

pink flowers all over it.

coming up.  The road on which you are traveling continues to the 
south through the old town. Just south there is an intersection with an
old dirt road leading to an old house.   The buildings to the south look
old and rundown, you can hear a door banging in the wind.

Sitting Room~
You are standing in a sitting room.  This must be where the 
servants put all guests upon arrival.  There are many tasteful 
artworks placed throughout the room on every wall.  You can 
see to the east the entrance foyer and to the west the Mayor's 
smoking room.

Foyer~
You're standing in a large ornate foyer of the Mayor's 
Mansion.  To the west there is a small sitting room.  To the 
east you can see a door.  The house looks to be deserted but 
you can hear noises coming from all directions but you don't 
think anyone lives here as the house is severely rundown and in 
need of repair.  The walls have mold growing on them and the 
wallpaper is coming off the walls in patches.  There are huge 
cracks in the walls through water damage from many a cruel 
winter.

Kitchen~
You are standing in what once must have been a busy kitchen.  
There are pots and pans hanging from the ceiling above a huge 
wooden cutting block.  In the corner there is a huge wood 
stove with an exhaust duct above. You see a concrete sink 
which is crude in that it is no more than large concrete 
bucket. There is a door to the south which leads into an old 
dusty lane out back of the house.

that has long since run dry.

You are standing in the passageway of a old rundown hotel.  
There are doors on either side all the way down the corridor.  At the 
end you see a small narrow staircase.  You think you see 
something in the corner of your eye, but when you look back it 
is gone. You get an eerie feeling from what seems to be a 
deserted hotel, like there is something in here that is not 
quite living.

Passageway~
You are standing in a passageway in an old hotel before the narrow staircase.
There are doors either side of you here and all the way down the 
passageway.  You can see old gas lanterns attached to the wall in-between the 
rooms however they are old and in need of repair. You sense movement at the 
bottom of the stairs but when you look you cannot see a thing.
You feel the presence of the strange mythical being throughout this
building.

Oak Tree Lane~
You are standing on Oak Tree Lane.  You can SEE to your north 
the Mayor's Mansion.  Although you don't think that he lives 
here anymore from the state of the house.  There is a large 
verandah circling the home but it looks dangerous to walk on 
now.  You can imagine during hot summers that occupants would 
sit outside on wicker chairs drinking cool lemonade and 
watching the sunset.  But now the house stands vacant and 
lifeless, or so it seems.

It is cramped in here. There are flies all around and despite the stables
not being used for a while, the smell is quite overpowering.

Stables~
You are standing in a cramped, dark, dusty stable.  Small flecks of outside
light peek through tiny cracks in the walls and the air smells musty. The
floor underfoot feels hard.

Farmhouse Entrance~
You are standing in the entrance to an old farmhouse. To the north you see
a bedroom.  To the east you see the living room. The floorboards creak as
you tread. The windows have no glass in them and the wind blows freely
through.  A shiver goes up your spine as the cold wind surrounds you.

Farmhouse Living Room~
You are standing in the farmhouse living room. To the north you see
the sewing room. To the east you see a kitchen. A few rustic chairs are
scattered haphazardly about. You hear a scurry of small feet and a small
furry mouse rushes past you and into a hole in the wall. Cobwebs sway
in the light breeze.

Farmhouse Kitchen~
You are standing in the east end of the kitchen in the old farm house.  In
the corner you see a large old wood stove.  In the middle of the room there
is a large oak table large enough for six.  On the table you see a cutting
board with what looks like shriveled pumpkin pieces from a dinner long since
eaten.  There is a big RAT standing in the corner LOOKing at 
you.

Cellar~
You are standing in a dark cellar.  The only light is that from the kitchen
above.  As your eyes adjust you see walls of preserves and a elaborate wine
collection that has been left.  Some of these bottles must be worth a fortune!
The dank smell of mildew fills the air and you wonder how long it's been since
someone has entered this room.

swinging in the breeze.  To the west you see the old Town Hotel.  You spot
something moving in a second floor window but it is gone before you can
get a good look.  You feel a cold chill move over your body like someone
just walked over your grave.  To the south you see where Blue Creek Road
bends to the east.

horse manure fills the air but there is none to be seen.  To the east you
can see a small stable that once housed one of the Mayor's horses.

You are standing inside one the largest stables.  This is where the
Mayor's horse must have lived.  The walls are padded and a large feed
trough covers the east end on the other side of the stable.  There is still
soft straw on the floor which should have rotted away with time.  You get
a eerie feeling about this place, one that you cannot shake.

You are spellbound!  Where could this straw possibly come from!  The eerie
feeling that affected you since entering this town has grown into
a overwhelming fear.  There is something not right in this town.

Barn~
You are standing in the middle of the farm's barn.  All about you is old
and rusted farm equipment.  There is a shovel and a pick laying against
the wall of the barn.  A strange thought strikes you that has been bothering
you since you entered this town.  It looks like the people of this town
just left and never came back.  It does not look like the people packed up
and moved out.

see streams of light passing between the boards that are the walls of the
barn.  There are small stalls that must have housed the farm's old plow
horse and other assorted farm animals.

Loft in Barn~
You are standing in the loft of the barn.  You can see down into the darkness
of the barn that is slightly illuminated by the light streaming in from
the barn door.  This must be the place where the farmer stored all his feed
for the animals.  A mouse scuttles past your feet which gives you quite a
shock. If you LOOK you can see the MOUSE.

Barn Roof~
You are standing on the barn roof.  From here you can see most of the town
and surrounding area.  Unfortunately there is not much to see apart from the
town but its a nice view anyway.  You can see for miles in each direction
to where the sky meets the earth.

Top of Barn Roof~
You are standing on the top of the barn roof.  Its quite dangerous up here
and you feel like you might slip and fall.  The wind blows harder up here
and you are finding it quite hard to keep your balance.  Probably best
you don't risk your neck and return back into the barn.

Hotel Manager's Office~
You are standing in the Manager's Office, there is a large oak desk with many
papers scattered upon it.  On the corner of the desk you see an old mechanical
counting machine that was used years ago.  The manager's chair is nothing
more than a stump with a piece of wood nailed to it for a back rest. 
You SEE a small mouse scamper past your feet, it turns and looks at you 
and then runs away.

Blue Creek Rd~
You are standing on Blue Creek Road, the main street of the 
town.  To your north you can see the road out of town and to 
the south the road bends to the east out of sight.  To the 
east you can see what used to be the Gunsmith and to the west 
is the old Hotel.  Nature has been cruel to this town, there 
is not one building that has not been cruelly affected by the 
harsh elements.  The wind whistles past your ears as you take 
in the obvious layout, as you look past the hotel you think 
you see a figure in the upstairs window. When you look back 
the figure is gone.  This spooky town might just be sending 
you a bit silly.

you can see the main street of town and further east is the 
old hotel.  The walls are filled with racks containing guns of 
every size and description.  The guns are covered in dust and 
cobwebs, they look like they haven't been touched in years.  
Beneath the guns on a shelf are rows and rows of ammunition.  
You think it is strange that this shop is so well stocked 
considering that it is in a deserted town.

School Playground~
You are standing in the northeastern end of the playground.  
There is a shoddy see-saw made from an old plank of wood and 
a barrel.  The handle has fallen off one side and it is 
cracked in several places.  To the east you can see some 
swings made from old tires tied to a tree.

School Playground~
You are standing in the southernmost end of the playground.  
There is a small slide here made from a plank of wood and a 
ladder.  It looks like it would give you some nasty splinters 
if you tried to slide down it so you decide not to give it a 
try.  Just to the east you can see the entrance to the school 
house.

Small Cell~
You are standing in an old prison cell.  You can hear the 
sound of water running and there is a is a definite 
chill in the room.  The only light entering the room is from the 
small window high on the wall with bars on it.  One side of 
the wall has a wide shelf that must double for a bed.  A small 
dusty moth ridden blanket is scrunched up in the corner 
presumably used as a pillow.

Old Dirt Rd, near Pony Express Station~
You are on an old dirt road in the southeast end of the town.  From 
here you can see the back of the shop buildings at the center 
of town.  To the north is the Pony Express Station.  Over the 
tall overgrown grass to the south you can see in the distance 
an old fort.  Although the fort is now deserted you can almost 
still see the guards standing at their posts.

Old Dirt Rd at the dead end.~
You are standing at the end of the Old Dirt road.  You are 
surrounded by large trees and bushes that block the path 
east.  What once could have been a path is now a dead end and 
the only way out is the way you came.  The town looks so 
peaceful from here, it is hard to now imagine the uneasiness 
you felt while you were roaming the uninhabited buildings.

Fort Blue Creek~
You are standing in the middle of Blue Creek Fort just before 
the Major's Office.  It is an attractive looking building or 
must have been in its time.  The weather has done some serious 
damage to the roof but it still holds its charm, it must have 
been the Major's pride and joy.  If you LOOK hard enough you 
might see it.

Major's Office~
The Major's Office is gloomy, lit by one sole candle.  There are war
plans scattered all over the place, though the furniture is the finest 
you have ever seen.  A realistic portrait of the Major hangs on the far 
wall, unbelievably untouched after  all these years.  As you take a
closer look at the portrait a cold shiver runs down your spine. 
You swear that Major's eyes are following you around the room!

Fort Blue Creek~
You are standing on the west side of the Fort alongside the 
wall behind the Major's Office. There is a small window here 
and you wipe away some dirt from the window to look inside.  
You see a large desk with war plans spread all over it.  As 
you peer around the room you see a frightening sight.  There 
is a small candle burning on the desk.  This is even more 
frightening than the foot!

You are standing on the east parapet circling the fort.  The 
view of the area south of the Fort is breathtaking.  The smooth 
sand of the desert varies from orange to ruby red across the 
horizon.  You think that you would probably die crossing that 
desert and you consider that irony of nature.

combs and hoof picks stacked neatly on a shelf.  You wonder 
how the troops could have ridden out of this town without 
their bridles and saddles. You can see the stables to your

western tower.  Just outside the wall you can see stakes 
poking out of the ground with scalps attached to the tops.  
Most of the scalps are of short dark hair, but there are a 
few longer ones.  Natives must have run rampant in the town 
scalping men and woman alike.  No wonder it looks as if no one 
ever moved out.  They didn't, they were KILLED!!

the middle of the Fort there is a well that still looks to be 
full of water.  There is a well built cabin on the east side 
and next to it some stables.  From here you can see all the 
spent gun casings sparkling in the sunlight.

and rows of stakes with scalps attached to the tops.  You can 
see huge blow flies buzzing around the scalps even from here.  
One of the scalps belonged to a little girl by the looks of it 
as it has long blond curls with pale blue ribbons tied to the 
bottom.

parapet.  You wonder what sort of tortures the people of this 
town had to endure on the last days of their time on this 
earth...  Or were they their last days?  You read somewhere that 
those tortured souls that died a violent death never really 
leave the earth, but spend endless days roaming their homes 
as if they hadn't died, somehow not admitting to the death.  
In view of what you have seen of this town you think it a 
possibility.

Half Built Church~
You are standing in the northwest corner of the old half 
built church.  There are two rows of pews lined up all the way 
down to the back of the church.  There is no roof on this 
church which strikes you as quite strange.  But you figure 
that rooves are pretty expensive, and with the Preacher dipping 
into the sacrificial wine and all there can't be too much 
money left over.  Specially with attendance being so low 
lately which would have had an adverse affect on donations.

Altar at Half Built Church~
You are standing at the alter of a half built church.  You can 
see right down the center of the church onto Little Rock 
Street.  There are pews on either side of the aisle from one 
end to the other.  Behind the altar there is a large crucifix 
with the figure of Jesus nailed to it.  You look closer at the 
likeness and realize that it is crying tears of blood.  Blood 
drips onto the floor and starts gathering about your feet.

You are standing in the northwest corner of an old half built 
church.  There are pews spreading down the entire length of 
the church.  You can see several small bibles and hymn books 
scattered about the floor.  The books are tattered and yellow 
and falling apart due to water damage from the open roof.

Your are standing on the graveyard path just west of the small 
gate.  All around you can gravestones of differing sizes 
desecrated by the harsh elements of the desert.  Beside you is 
a small headstone marking the grave of a newborn child.  Beside it 
is the child's mother who died on the same day in childbirth.

down the path.  You can see here the grave of Takiness, she died 
frothing at the mouth in a psychopathic rage where she 
swallowed her own tongue.

Top of the Hill~
You are standing in a small clearing at the top of Boot Hill. 
This is the highest point of the whole town.  You can see for 
miles around.  Over to the east you can see Fort Blue Creek.  
Just north of there is an old dirt road that separates the 
north and south ends of the old town.  There are a pack of 
vultures flying circling over your head.  The path down the 
hill is seemingly non-existent now, only a few broken twigs 
mark the path you traveled up the hill.

death and decay.  You stand in petrified silence as the

You are standing inside the old grave.  It is small and cramped and you
wonder what possessed you to enter this tomb.  It is dark and you can
smell the obvious odour of decay.  As you wait for your eyes to adapt
to the darkness the slab of concrete closes over your head.
