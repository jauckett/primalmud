Karakas~ 
A temple against the backdrop of a huge desert, twinkles in the sunlight. 
Rumours suggest  that a huge land wurm guards the temple from mortal folk 
occasionally showing itself by burrowing through the sand and surprising 
unwary adventures. 
 
``To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,  
     One clover, and a bee,  
     And revery.''

Shimmering against the desert is a strange temple. Little more than a speck

Grassy Plains~ 
The beauty of this place fills you with hope, joy and goodness. The plains  
stretch far into the horizon, you can see rolling hills covered in long 
grass and clumps of trees scattered everywhere. You can hear wolves howling  
and the faint beating of hooves on the ground as well at the occasional 
ruffle of beating wings. In the distance far to the North you can see what 
appears to be a small town.

The worn trail to Icatia turns towards the west. You can see the town wall 
is very close now. To the east you can see a small hamlet with a large field 
full of wheat, there is a man dressed in a white robe scything his crop. 
There is something unnerving about this man.

Swords to Plowshares~ 
The man in his white robe greets you and beckons you towards him. As you get 
closer you can see he has small blood stains on his robe and scythe. As you 
extend your hand to shake hands with him, he swings his scythe at your neck. 
Everything seems to go blurry and you feel blood trickle down you neck from 
a paper thin cut. As your head hits the ground you can see the robed man 
working your body parts into the soil for next years crop. YOU ARE DEAD!

large stone wall and a deep moat. Occasionally you see ripples and a 
thrashing tail on the surface of the moat.

To the west down the precipitous gorge you can see a massive Raging River. 
There appear to be several battles going on either side of the river. To the

The trail winds its way along the mountainside, around outcropping's that you 
were sure no-one could traverse. Another rope bridge spans the Raging River. 
This one looks equally dangerous. Looking up above you and to the south you 
see a strange castle, which looks even more unusual closer up. The cliff 
still is far to steep to climb however. You can follow a steep path which 
winds its way up and around the south of the base of the castle.

crawling around in the mud, while Merfolk attend to their business in   
the water above, ignoring the Homarids. The carvings are captioned in a  
language closely related to Common (or so you suppose, as you can read  
it).  The carvings seem to cover the entire wall. A rough translation of  
the pictures and writing can be worked out:  
   "Knowing that this temple is sacred to Svyelun, I write this message   
to those who come after, to explain the demise of the Vodalian Empire.   
As the climate grew warmer, the crustaceans living in the deeps of the   
sea, that we call "Homarids" began to multiply at an alarming rate. At   
first we neglected them, thinking that their threat would soon vanish.

moon, and their strength grows as the tide flows. Without strong   
leaders, we will surely fail. We have sent to Atlantis for help. The  
Lord himself is coming to aid us, but whether he gets to us in time is  
in the hands of Svyelun."

"The homarids are here again! They fight tirelessly, neither sleeping or

There is a large hole in the floor, which affords a view of several

very foamy looking sea. Looking down gives you vertigo.

they swim just below the surface of the water, making you shudder with   
disgust at the thought of their slimy bodies touching you.  
To the north you can see a bubbling quagmire.

A bubbling quagmire.~
You are barely able to stay above the surface of this quagmire. The air   
is filled with the stench of rotting vegetable matter, and some unknown   
odour, slightly like decaying flesh, also fills your nose.  
Looking down at the bubbling mass, you pray you don't fall in. Hate to   
think what's under there.

Surrounded by boiling mud.~
As your body touches the mud, you scream in agony, for the mud is   
boiling with a heat sufficient to strip flesh from bone. As you sink   
lower, your agony increases, until you think you can bear it no longer,   
but then, suddenly, you fall into an open space.  
  
You lie recovering on the ground.

the castle are constructed from a dark, coarse looking stone, and a   
large gate of black iron to the east bars the entrance to the castle.  
Scattered around the gate are the bones of unlucky adventurers. They   
look almost gnawed.

	The melancholy waters lie.

Inside Urborg: Southeast corner of the cavern.~
You stand in a large cavern. The air here is scorching, making breathing   
very difficult. In the centre a fire roars, seemingly feeding off the   
stone itself. In the centre of the blaze looms a huge black figure,   
casting a massive shadow across the cavern.   
 Around the blaze dance hundreds of tiny, warped figures, chanting their   
fear and adoration to their lord. The chittering of their voices rises   
even above the roar of the blaze.

Urborg: Atop a turret.~
From here you can see the lands surrounding the castle, Urborg.  
The misty swamp stretches off to the horizon in all four directions.  
To the Northwest a ruined tower squats in the swamp.  
Around the turret fly dozens of batlike shapes.  In the centre of the   
turret is a deep well, from which bursts a beacon of demonic red light.

You are knee deep in putrid black water, the sounds of swamp life

seems to suck warmth from your body. Unknown creatures cause ripples as   
they swim just below the surface of the water, making you shudder with   
disgust at the thought of their slimy bodies touching you.

Pendelhaven~ 
A huge oak spreads its branches protectively over the glade in which you now 
find yourself. As you look up into its branches, you are awestruck by the 
sheer age of this tree. It must be a good thirty metres thick, and its top is 
out of the range of your vision. The clearing appears to have formed in the 
enormous umbra of the tree - clearly not enough daylight filters through the 
multiple layers of leaves to nourish anything other than the thin layer of 
grass which covers the ground. An unusual exception is a small patch of flow-
ers growing just before the oak. The trees of the forest line the edge of the 
clearing in solemn vigil. Small animals scurry to and fro, apparently indif-
ferent to your presence. To the north lies a small pond, and there appear to 
be paths to east and west. 
"This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the

Pendelhaven Pool~ 
A gentle stream flowing from the southwest idles to a halt for a while, crea-
ting a pool whose clarity is profound that it seems almost, but not quite, 
unnatural. Beneath the surface, minnows dart to and fro, chased lazily by 
larger shapes. You could spend a lot of time relaxing here, though for some 
reason actually catching any of the fish doesn't particularly appeal to you.  
The water from the pond eventually spills over a rock ledge to the north and 
flows out of sight around a bend a little way down.

Shrine to Thelon~ 
At first glimpse, this airy shrine is as beautiful and peaceful as the glade 
below - a gracious pavilion, supported by four major branches of the mighty 
Pendelhaven oak, opening out onto the canopy of the enormous forest. Knots and 
lumps in the branches provide comfortable seating, and there is what appears 
to be some kind of parasitic woody bush growing in their fork which bears a 
remarkable resemblance to an altar, if you ignore its distinctly uneven 
surface. The view is SPECTACULAR. The wind blows the leaves of the canopy, 
making them ripple like green water, and the sound of their movement increases 
the resemblance to an enormous viridian ocean. Above you, the tree continues 
its heliotropic ascent.  
However, there is a subtle sense of menace which was definitely NOT present 
below. You find it hard to relax properly.

The altar appears to be made of a woody bush, trimmed of foliage, and grown 
inside some kind of cuboid. Its surface is lumpy as the branches which form it 
intertwine, but its overall shape is remarkably regular. The roots of the bush 
appear to sink directly into the tree below. Its surface appears to have some 
unusual stains, which just look like shadows at first sight.

As you bend to examine the altar more closely, foot-long, razor-sharp thorns 
spring suddenly from its surface. As you jerk backwards, one of them just 
scratches your face. The blood trickles down the thorn and vanishes into the 
tangle of branches which forms the altar. All around you, the massive 
Pendelhaven oak shifts as it senses the presence of possible nutrition. No 
wonder the oak is so large! Sickened, you stumble away from the altar. The 
thorns reluctantly retract.

breeze.) Your eyes slowly adjust and you can make out vague outlines of fungi

Looking carefully, you eventually find a half-vanished piece of carving edging 
out from one of the eroded patches of bark. It says "...or the

You are in a curious clearing on a path travelling east-west. What makes this 
clearing unusual is not the appearance of the glade, which is not particularly 
out of the ordinary (ie remarkably beautiful), but rather its sound. It's 
quite hard to describe, but the breeze here sounds almost hungry - yet 
simultaneously it is somehow completely unthreatening. (Perhaps the breeze is 
not carnivorous, although how you'd tell I don't know.) There is an eerie 
beauty to the noise which you find almost hypnotic.

Interesting... These trees are actually covered by the canopy, which they do 
not reach. It's a rather bizarre sight - what at first glance is a normal (-

You are surprised to find that there is something carved onto on of these 
trees - you'd have thought they deserved better. However, it isn't the usual 
graffito - instead, it is a rather beautiful design, elaborating on, and 
complementing, the natural patterning of the bark and the elegant curves of 
the tree.

The basic form is similar to Celtic knotwork, a constant intertwining of 
graceful curves which ultimately fold back in on themselves and turn out to be

You suddenly emerge into a clearing before another massive tree. This tree, 
however, is also a formidable fortress for someone or other. Extending high 
into the air above you, it is swarming with defenses, some attached to the 
tree and some apparently part of it. Somehow you are inclined to guess that 
the Elves who live in this forest have something to do with this. We suggest 
you ask permission before attempting entry.

musical instruments and consume enormous amounts of food and (last but not

Periodically the music lapses into what sounds like complete anarchy, but the 
dissonances sooner or later resolve back into what are occasionally very 
beautiful musical phrases.

Party Pool 
~ 
Shrieks and splashing are your first impression of this pool. There must be 
about twenty or thirty assorted sentients, all stark naked, engaged in 
assorted aquatic activities, ranging from simple swimming, to dunking, 
swinging on ropes above the pond, diving and the ever-popular soaking each 
other in every way imaginable. You find yourself suddenly drenched as a dryad 
ducks and leaves you in the line of fire.

Elven Fortress Entry~ 
You are standing at the foot of the enormous tree out of which the Elven 
Fortress was... built? grown? Its shadow is so immense that the air is 
distinctly cooler here. The roots of the tree frame two enormous portals, 
slightly ajar; through the gap you glimpse a sizeable courtyard. Shaped - NOT 
carved - into the wood are elvish runes, as well as a warning in Common. You 
get a distinct feeling of unwelcomeness.

Elven Ramparts~ 
A three-metre-wide branch of the fortress provides a vantage-point for 
Llanowar warriors to monitor activity in the clearing below. The branch, 
despite its incredible girth, sways sickeningly in what are really rather 
marginal winds, making it impossible for you, if (unfortunately) not the 
elves, to maintain a stable footing. Towards the north, ie trunkward, end of 
the branch, a cluster of vines suspends what looks like a big load of wood. 
Around you, the canopy of the forest sprawls towards the horizon in  
all directions.

As you enter this courtyard, the gates slam shut behind you, belying the

innumerable arrow-shafts. With the clarity that often precedes death, you 
notice a number of things:

* the makeshift stables, housing... wolves?? 
* the large number of murder holes - D'OH

Hollow Trees~ 
After travelling through a long, windy (in both senses) corridor, you have 
entered an underground cave filled with the most extraordinary noise. Wind 
tears through here from holes all round the edge of the cavern and rushes 
upwards, carrying with it leaves, dirt, stones, and even fair-sized rocks. 
Following the direction of a frighteningly large specimen, you have time to 
notice that what you took for stalactites, hanging from the roof of the cave, 
are in fact tree roots. You suddenly realise that unless you have a fly spell 
active, you are going to be dragged by the wind up into the long wooden 
tunnels you assume are the trunks of trees and shot up into the air...

You're surprised that there is any down left, given the force of the suction; 
it appears to be one large rock. It is glowing in a greedy sort of way. If you 
actually venture towards it, you'll inevitably be sucked up through one of the 
tree-trunks.

from the centre of the earth. Kind to his people, Suleiman protected them from a most 
grizzly destruction.

Feldon~ 
An explorer and apprentice magician, Feldon was recognised as a force 
after he found a valuable cane while hunting in the Ronom Glacier. No 
other canes of this sort were ever found, so Feldon became more powerful 
than even he had ever hoped. 
 
Feldon found the first of these canes frozen in the Ronom Glacier.

Tawnos~ 
Apprentice to the famous artificer Urza, he was recognised in his own 
right when he made some startling inventions that even Urza was 
impressed with. Creating often simple artifacts and always looking for a 
way to cut down on resources Tawnos was promoted to master. 
 
Tawnos won fame as Urza's greatest assistant. After he created these 
warriors, Urza ended his apprenticeship, promoting him directly to the 
rank of master.

Urza~ 
Apprentice of Tocasia, and brother and enemy to Mishra, Urza was always 
seeking new ways to defeat his brother. While he created a many more 
artifacts and better resource gathering techniques, he was still a long 
way from defeating Mishra. 
 
When sorely wounded or tired, Urza would often retreat to the  
workshops of his apprentices. They were greatly amazed at how much  
better he looked each time he took a sip of water. 
 
Urza always put Tocasia's lessons on resource-gathering to  
    effective use.

Mishra~ 
Apprentice of Tocasia, and brother and enemy to Urza, Mishra was far 
more inclined to create one crushing artifact, and use it to achieve a 
single goal, rather than haphazardly create several less effective 
creations. Requiring just one workshop and one factory, 
Mishra was every bit as powerful as Urza.  
 
Though he eventually came to despise Tocasia, Mishra listened  
well to her lessons on clarity of purpose. Unlike his brother, he  
focused his mind on a single goal.

Absent-minded, but able to create the most hideous inventions, 
she required the soul and often the body of followers to work her 
artifacts. Not an evil person, just entirely devoted to her work, Ashnod 
never had many friends. 
 
Ashnod found few willing to trade their humanity for the power  
she offered them.

You seem to have taken a wrong turn. There is no apparent exit from
this darkened cell. Slits in the roof far above you allow faint 
shafts of light to win through to the floor. The walls are sheer
and unclimbable. Mounted on all of the walls are manacles, from
some of which dangle ancient skeletons.
As you admire the scenery, a grinding noise starts, and the east and west
walls, covered in vicious spikes, start to move towards you.
You attempt to escape, but before you can do so the spikes close
on you, piercing deep into your body and letting your blood run all
over the floor.
This is the Oubliette. Good luck escaping.

posters poster~
The largest poster is a scene of magical combat between two planeswalkers, set
in  a large ocean with craggy skull-shaped rocks rising from it. The caption
along the bottom of the poster read:
	"A MULTIVERSE OF INFINITE POSSIBILITIES"
Apparently inspired by Magic: The Gathering, and drawn by Mark Teddin and
Anson Maddocks.

Anothe poster is of a huge, moss covered tree, deep in the untouched 
Tasmanian rainforest. The caption reads:
	"WILDERNESS not WOODCHIPS"

Also on the wall is a framed print of a mage battling a dragon on the top
of a crumbling tower.

moon temple print~
A ruined temple surrounded by lush gardens, suspended in midair. Tiny streams
run off the edge of the rock and deep within the temple an eerie light pulses.
The entire scene is lit by a brilliant full moon.

E
computer desk~
The computer is a 686 P120+, with 32 Megabytes of RAM, a 1.7 Gigabyte 
hard drive and a hex-speed CD-ROM. Also on the desk is a 15" low 
radiation monitor and a pair of large 120W speakers. A CD is in the 
drive, and from the speakers float the strains of Pachelbel's Canon in 
D-minor.

double bed~
The bed is made up with cool cotton sheet. Only half of it is,
the other being devoted to textbooks, novels, bits of paper
and magic cards. The frame is of undressed pine, and several
of the slats supporting the matress are broken, attesting to
some heavy use.

The library is a fantasy buff's dream come true. All four 
walls are lined with books, all fantasy or science fiction. 
In the centre of the room is a roaring fireplace surrounded 
by comfy chairs and couches. The room is filled with a soft 
yellow light, neither hurting your eyes nor hindering reading 
in any way.

The Magic Room~
The room has been devoted to the worship of "Magic: The Gathering".
All four walls are covered in cards and posters from the game.
In the centre of the room is a huge circular table, crafted from
ebony and polished to perfection. Lying around the room are boxes
of cards and Magic accessories.

walls cards~
The walls are covered in thousands of cards, each unique. It seems that
a full set of cards has been stuck on the walls. The history of magic,
Alpha/Beta/Unlimited, Revised and 4th Edition, Arabian Nights, 
Antiquaties, Legends, The Dark, Fallen Empires, Ice Age, Homelands,
Alliances, even a few Mirages. Scattered amongst the sets are the
promotional cards.
Framed on the walls are the rarest and most expensive cards in existence,
a full set of Alpha Moxes and a Black Lotus.
~
E
table~
The table is smooth as glass, and feels slightly warm to the touch. A
perfect surface to play Magic on. The ebony of the table shows up the cards
to excellent effect. Strewn on the table are several dismembered decks, 
mostly blue/black combinations.

Rass's R&R Room~
A large conversation pit takes up most of the floorspace of the room, with 
plush, megacomfy sofa-seating all around the walls. In the middle is an
unusual piece of furniture: a two-foot rim of warm marble surrounds a king-
size waterbed. Above all the seats are shelves, mostly full of books but
with boxes of pencils and paints scattered here and there among them.
There is no visible roof, and trees are visible above the tops of the
shelves, but something seems to be keeping the weather off.

Three series by Dorothy Dunnet: The House of Niccolo, the Lymond Saga, and
    the Johnson Johnson books.
The Earthsea Quartet by Ursula Le Guin, along with lots of her other books
Lots of Ray Bradbury
Lots of Terry Dowling, particularly the Rynosseros series
A complete set of Michael Leunig's books
....and on and on.

A large dusty room full of old crates and boxes is lit by just one  
tiny shuttered window. Old paintings and clothes as well as various  
swords and armor lies here. One chest is filled with gems and gold coins 
while another has various valuable trinkets in it.

A huge room, detailed with gold banisters, plush red carpet and

A beautifully maintained garden with miniature streams and ponds crammed with  
bright goldfish and colourful flowers from all over the realms form almost a  
miniature botanical garden. Deep into the garden is a small gazebo perched on top 
of a small hill. Moss covered rocks shade a lush fern gully and several fruit 
trees are bursting with ripe fruits.
