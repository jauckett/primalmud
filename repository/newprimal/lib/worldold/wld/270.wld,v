Inside the Biology lab~
This is a small biology lab within the submarine's hub. Due to lack of
space it is relatively sparse. There is a shelf of books and papers, a
small computer and a workspace that is covered with petri dishes. To the east
is the small workstation and there is a door to the south leading onto D deck

The scuttle can be opened up into the depths of the ocean. It has a glass lid that allows
you to see what is swimming past. However opening it may not be a wise idea, all that
tones of freezing water rushing towards you would surely mean death.

There is a sign on the grey wall that tells you which way to head. 
It is poorly lit and difficult to read. The whole area is in fact rather
depressing and there is a stale smell in the air.

What should appear like a normal closet, is in reality a horrific sight. 
The whole of the closet is covered in a blue fungi, 
that seems to pulse as if alive. What was once books and manuals are now
folds of fungi that have a surreal appearence.
It is probably best stay out and lock the door.

Drowning in the ocean~
How stupid to actually open the scuttle and enter into the depths of the ocean.
This would have to be the fastest way to a watery grave that anyone has taken.
The scuttle has closed behind you and there is no way out. 
You will have to drown!!

Inside the Engine room~
The engine room is directly bellow C deck. There is usually at least one 
machanic here making sure everything runs smoothly, even though over
eighty percent of the technology that runs this sub is computer based.
However today the engine room is strangely empty. The machines are still
running smoothly but no one is here supervising.

difference with C is that the floor is a hard wire mesh that allows easy
access the the millions of wires and cables that run through the heart of
the sub.

The hallway is completely dark making it difficult to 
determine what lies ahead. It appears that the space ship 
is devoid of life from here, but it is difficult to tell.
The air is slightly corrosive and devoid of enough oxygen to breathe freely. 
There is also a slight dampness in the air, 
possibly from the amount of time this vessel has been under water.
To the east there is an entrance to the galley 
and the hallway continues to the north and south.

The sphere itself is smooth and slightly damp. 
It is completely quiet in here and nothing can be heard from the outside. 
There is also a thick blanket of foam that causes you to float through and around, 
which is a strange sensation.

Around the outer wall~
There are many pieces of equipment and weaponary that have been left scattered around
the outside wall. They are all over ten feet tall, some even reaching fifty feet.
This indicates how massive this room actually is, when machinary of this size looks
so small. The wall leads north and south around the outskirts of this room

From this side of the room a large Sphere is visible.

A closer look may reveal what the object is made from, 
but from this distance it is impossible to determine very much.

Inside the Sphere~
The sphere is made of a strange substance, one that has never been seen before.
It is a metallic black, yet unlike metal, it is warm and soft to touch. There is
also a clear foam substance spread throughout the whole of the sphere.

Inside the Sphere~
Floating around the inside of the sphere, is a strange sensation. 
The air is breathable yet there is a foam-like substance that engulfs you. 
The whole place is devoid of any sound and trying to speak is nearly impossible. 
The sphere continues in circles to the west and north.

Around the Outer wall~ 
The wall itself is made from a strange metal, and the air is still unbreathable, but
the strange yellow light that is radiating from the center of the room, give this place
a tranquil and calm appearance. The outer wall leads both north and south
from here.

and you have to wonder what they are doing here. The yellow light that penetrates
from the center  of the room is just as bright in the far corners. The outer wall
continues to the east and to the north the light seems even brighter

The Sphere is directly to the north and it is so large that it touches the ceiling, blocks
your view from anything behind it, and makes the fifty foot machinery lying around look tiny.
The sphere itself looks metal, but is warm to touch. There are also
strange markings on the sphere.
