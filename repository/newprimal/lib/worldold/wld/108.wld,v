Rushmoor swamp~
You are wandering the vast wasteland of Rushmoor swamp. Quaggy
mires stretch out in all directions as far as the eye can see.
The stench of decay is thick in the air and an erie mist rises
up from the ground. You can here the sinister chirpings of 
millions of frogs.

The ruins of a what appears to be a long abandoned keep rise out of the
swamp. Whether it was the outpost of a long dead civilisation or the
hold of a small lord you can't say. Now all that remains is crumbling
and decaying ruins.

choked with weeds, the paving stones broken and upturned by the passage of
many years.~

Jammed hard into the corner of the courtyard is the remains of a human
skeleton. The top half. Wearing armour and carrying a sword it looks as
if something has bitten off the bottom half of the body, but what could
bite through armour like that ? Just hope that whatever did it is long
gone.

A large tree overhangs this corner of the courtyard, cloaking it in shadows.
The branches are too high to reach and thin. You can see small animals and
several birds have made the tree their home. Trees this size are rare in
