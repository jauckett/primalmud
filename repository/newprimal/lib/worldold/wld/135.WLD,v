The Foyer, northwest corner~
You are in the corner of a seedy Whorehouse foyer, which continues south
and east from here. Just here the atmosphere is a little bit quieter,
and it is difficult to get a good view of the stage due to the intervening
and enthusiastic crowd. Some worn out looking rustic locals are relaxing
here between bouts, seated round a small table playing poker with a
distinctive pack of cards.

The foyer continues east. On the wall near here you can see some sort of
sign, and a bit further on, a clockwork-driven vending machine. Maybe
you can get a better view of the stage from there?

The Foyer, northern end~
You are near the northern wall of the tawdry Whorehouse foyer, which
continues a short way west and a bit further east; the heart of the room
is towards the south where a large crowd watches the raised stage and the
scantily dressed dancers performing on it. From here you have a fairly
good view of both the stage and the band - not that anyone is watching
the band! The people right here around you are a little rowdy, but more
subdued than those closer to the 'entertainment'.

On the wall right here you can see an advertising sign...

The Foyer, northern end~
You are near the northern wall of the garish Whorehouse foyer, which
continues a short way east and a bit further west from here; to the south
is the heart of the room where the dancers dance on a raised stage, the
musicians muse in front of them, and the crowd crowds round them. From
here you have a reasonably good view of the goings on but you could
probably find a better vantage point a bit further south.

Just near the wall right here is a rickety old mechanically operated
vending machine - on it you can see some printed instructions...

The Foyer, northeast corner~
You are in the corner of the sordid Whorehouse foyer, which continues
south and west from here. This corner is pretty bare and empty, perhaps
because it's a bad angle to view the stage from which is a little way
south from here. You have a sense though that the more 'private' business
dealings take place not too far from here...

On the wall right here is a noticeboard covered in pictures.

South from here there is more of a crowd, quite close to the stage and
whooping it up in appreciation of the dancing girls' choreography, anatomy
and costumery. Occasionally you see men and girls enter and leave east
from there, near the stage. Hmmm...

are on the edges of a fairly rowdy crowd which is concentrated round the
raised stage the dancers use, a little south and east from here - your
view of proceedings is slightly hampered by the surrounding crowd, and you
think you could get a better view a bit further east...

The Foyer~
You are near the centre of the gaudy Whorehouse foyer, surrounded by a
thick cheering drunken lust-soaked crowd of ne'er-do-wells. The
atmosphere is less than salubrious to say the least. To the south and
west the crowd is just as thick, to the north and east it is a little
roomier but with probably not as good a view of the performances on
stage as you have here.

You have a pretty damn fine view of both the band and the stage from here.

To the south the crowd is if anything even thicker than here, when you

band~
There's an old saying about ending up playing piano in a whorehouse...
danged if I can remember it, podner, but it's probably not a recommendation,
based upon the surly miens and half-competent playing of the members of
*this* band; one gets the feeling if they were good enough musicians to
work elsewhere they would be doing so. The crowd doesn't seem to mind,
however.
~
E

You can see various feathers, boas, fans, swirling pantaloons, daringly
bare shins and even other parts of the anatomies of the busy young
girls from here, as they fling their skirts to their air and any shame
over their shoulders...
~
E
dancers girls dancing~
The girls are young and pretty and have skin that isn't too blemished
by 19th century standards. The dance they are doing does not have a
name but involves much bending over, turning round, high-kicking,
bouncing and jiggling and movement in general, all the time accompanied
by saucy and cheeky grins from the girls getting tips from the customers,
and bored dull resentfulness from those who are not.

You are near the centre of the clinquant Whorehouse foyer, just north
of the band. The over-decorated profusion of tackiness doesn't seem to
worry the clientele, who surround you in a noisy profusion of yelled
obscenities and the stink of sweat and trail-dust. To the north the
crowd is a little thinner, to the west it seems just the same as here.
To the east, though, you notice men and women entering and leaving
regularly.

You have an excellent view of both the band and the show on the stage
from here.

Next to the Stage~
You are in the grimy Whorehouse Foyer, near the stage - in fact, 
you are standing just north of the 'stage right' side of the stage.
You can't climb onto the stage from here as it is too high, instead 
you'd have to go round the front which is west and south from here.
To the west is a large press of people watching the show, and to the
north is the northeast corner of the foyer, where you can just see
some sort of noticeboard on the wall. The view of the dancing isn't
that great from here because the angle is wrong; but most people here
are coming and going *up*, through a curtained doorway... You have a
strong feeling they are moving with purpose.

Whorehouse Foyer, near main door~

YOU ARE IN A BARE BONES VERSION OF:

You are standing near a door in the middle of the western wall of a large
tackily decorated room full of drunken men, scantily clad women and an
atmosphere of vice and debauchery. Semi-naked girls dance on a raised
stage to the incompetent strains of the whorehouse band, a little way
east from here. The room is packed with people, especially towards the
centre, while at the edges there is a little more room to move. The walls
are covered with signs, notices and pictures. To the west is the passageway
to the street.

find yourself standing right in the thickest part of the crowd here,
just in front of the band who play their off key dance tunes slightly
east from here. You can see that the very best view of the stage, and
the dancing girls performing on it, is probably from right here...
although maybe there's an even better view from where the band is? To
the west is the main entrance to the Whorehouse Foyer, and north and
south from here the crowd spreads out, watching the show...

worn down by thousands of dance steps over the years. It is raised up
and positioned in the middle of the eastern wall of the Whorehouse foyer,
which spreads out to your west. Just down from here is where the band plays
their off-key music to accompany the off-colour choreography this stage
was built for.

You are on the edges of a pretty noisy crowd which is bending its

disharmonious cacophany the band produces, as they appear to find the
onstage 'artistic' performances enthralling enough to create obliviousness
to other aesthetic spheres of appreciation.

Next to the Stage~
You are in the grimy Whorehouse Foyer, near the stage - in fact, you are
standing just south of the 'stage left' side of the stage. You can't
climb onto the stage from here as it is too high, instead you'd have
to go round the front which is west and north from here. To the west is
a large press of people watching the show, and to the south is the
southeast corner of the foyer, where you can just see some sort of
noticeboard on the wall. The view of the dancing isn't that great
from here because the angle is wrong; but most people here are coming
and going *up*, through a curtained doorway... You have a strong
feeling they are moving with purpose.

You see a short passageway south which in the middle branches off to the
east...

To the west the corridor disappears in dim dank semi-darkness and an
appreciable lack of class...

The Foyer, southwest corner~

YOU ARE IN A BAREBONES VERSION OF:

You are in the corner of a shabby Whorehouse foyer, which continues east
and north from here. You are away from the main bulk of the crowd here,
in fact it's almost a quiet nook of a corner, what with a couple of
armchairs and a small bookcase filled with questionable material. Perhaps
it's designed to get customers who can't see the show on the stage from
here 'in the mood' for a little business?

The Foyer, southern end~

YOU ARE IN A BAREBONES VERSION OF:

You are near the southern wall of the faded Whorehouse foyer, which
continues a short way west and a bit further east; the heart of the room
is north from here where a large and noisy crowd agglomerates round the
raised stage on which young ladies with out too many encumbering clothes
dance round and round and up and down.

There is a glass-doored cabinet here containing various bits and pieces,
bearing a sign...

The Foyer, southern end~

YOU ARE IN A BAREBONES VERSION OF:

You are near the southern wall of the unwholesome Whorehouse foyer, which
continues a short way east and a bit further west from here; to the north
is the centre of the room featuring some uninhibited dance steps from some
young ladies on a raised stage, and some enthusiastic support from a mass
of men of al ages.

There is a poster on the wall here.

The Foyer, southeast corner~

YOU ARE STANDING IN A BAREBONES VERSION OF:

You are in the corner of the slatternly Whorehouse foyer, which continues
south and west from here. This corner is rather bare and empty, perhaps
because it's a bad angle from which to view the stage, a little way
north from here. You have a sense though that the more 'private' business
dealings take place not too far from here...

On the wall right here is a noticeboard covered in pictures.

A Whore's Small Dirty Bedroom~
You are in a small cramped crooked room full of stale air and a cloying
odour of old ... sweat? Something unpleasant anyway. This is obviously
a room where the mattress tango is danced professionally. At least there's
a window here! There is also a door to the north leading to a dim dank
corridor.

Entryway to Whorehouse~

YOU ARE IN A BAREBONES VERSION OF:

You are in a small entry hall running west to a corner and east to a door,
through which you can hear a large crowd making a great deal of rowdy
noise, often using indecent language! There are sporadic outbursts of
cheerin', whistlin', hootin' and hollering' and you know anything may
happen once you step through that door, though you feel secure that even
now it is not too late to just back away quietly out to the street.

(NB door east to 13516 built from note given, though not in zone file)
