Outside gates~
Solid steel gates stand wide open as you approach the city. The gates are a 
foot wide! Magic must help open and close them, they are far too heavy to be 
moved by the hand of man. The tall city walls stretch 50 feet above the ground 
and through the open gates you can see the walls themselve are 30 or 40 feet 
of solid stone. Only a very large army or one with powerful magic wielding 
allies could hope to take the city without been slaughtered.

Southern highway~
Filling your vision to the north is the great wall surrounding the city
of Impulzarr. The wall stretchs for miles across to the east and out west
across the sea, guarding the large harbour of this coastal city.

Southern highway~
The Southern highway is the least busy of the three land bound ways into the
city of Impulzarr - but the paved road is still wide enough forthree wagons 
to travel abreast and the city still patrols it vigilantly.

Southern highway~
A small troop of cavalry from the city to the north travels down the highway.
The paved stone road is wide enough that neither you nor they need move aside.
With a searching glance the troop dig their heels in and continue southwards,
ensuring bandits and smaller jealous cities don't stop trade into or out
of the city.

Travelling along the smooth paved highway, runnning directly south from
the city, you can see a small campsite to the east - a regular stopping
point for weary travellers and traders making their way to the city.

Small hills rise up on either side of the wide road, but it carves through
them, turning to the west to the north. The hills here would make a perfect
place for an ambush by bandits, so keep a close eye out.

Southern highway~
Travelling along the highway you pass a merchants caravan heading towards
the city. A handful of guards ride alongside the wagons, looking like tree
trunks on horses, their arms as thick as most mens thighs. The only thing
harder then their muscles is probably the 'wood' between their ears.

Little more then an inn for passing travellers and a granary to serve the
surrounding farms. Bleary eyed wagoneers and merchant guards lounge around
outside the small inn waiting for opening time.

Grasslands~
Off the highway grasslands stretch away to the east and south. Miles to the
north the city of Impulzarr dominates the horizon, the largest city for
many thousands of leagues. Out to the west cliffs overlook a vast ocean,
strong winds and crashing waves pounding against the cliff face.

Cliff face~
Near the Southern highway out of the city great cliffs overlook a vast ocean
of water. Looking over the cliff face far below you can see waves crash onto
sharp rocks. Even if you survived a fall from this height you'd soon be
pounded into small pieces in the large waves below.

Off to the side of the highway the grass is trampled from regular use as
a camping ground by weary travellers before the last leg to the city.
A small fire pit in the ground shows signs of regular use, blackened
bones from a recent meal still unclaimed by predators.

A small copse of trees is the first sign of plant life taller then your

Short stunted growth no higher then your ankles are the only foliage over
the grass nearby, though you can see a small copse of trees off to the
west. A gopher raises its head out of a hole near your feet, but with
one glance at you it dives back in quick enough to make you doubt your
eyes.

Inn~
A handful of empty tables and a small dirty fire place are the 'highlights'
of the towns inn. The few locals having a quiet drink stop talking and
look at you when you open the door. I don't think they get too many
strangers passing through these parts.

House~
Dusty shelves along one wall and dust covered rotting furniture in a way
tell the tale of the town. Perched near the Southern Highway of Impulzarr
the town has fallen on hard times of late due to war in the lands to the
south drying up much of the trade.

Filled with the produce of the local farmers. Cracked bricks to the rear of 
the granary are letting small rodents in though. Maybe you tell the village
people, they don't look like they can afford the loss of even a small portion
of the meager crop.

before the desert appeared a century ago. Some say it was an act of a

whatever the cause the lands are slowly, but surely been buried under the

Mounted alongside the far wall looking out from the city is a large crossbow.
In times of need 2 or 3 soldiers would man the crossbow. One to aim the
device and another 1 or 2 ready to reload it as soon as a bolt is fired.
Although they take many times longer to load and fire the a longbow the
range of the device is a 100 yards further, able to reach beyond the
front lines of an incatious enemy.

Wall~
Stretching feet 50 feet high and 30 or 40 feet thick the strong stones walls
of the city have never been breached by hostile forces. Soldiers of the
city patrol along its length keeping an eye out for trouble.

Watch tower~
Standing high on the watchtower, you can see for miles in every direction. 
To the south the fiery desert, east across the vast plains of fields feeding 
the mighty city. To the west the sea of Stars, stretching to the horizon, 
beautiful, enchanting, merciless. And to the north, Impulzarr. Impulzarr. 
Called the Jewel of the North by it's citizens, less flattering things by 
smaller cities jealous of its power.

A small set of stone stairs set within the wall will take you up to the

and very thick. Glancing through the open doors you can see what appears 
to be quarters through one door, a small mess hall through the other.

Mess hall~
Built into the walls of the city, the mess hall is spartan. Every three 
days, the watch changes and there is nothing to say soldiers will serve 
at the same place along the wall again soon. A rough wooden bench and 
table are jammed into the room, with barely room to sit without been 
squashed against the walls. Two small doors, iron banded and with heavy 
locks lead out to the stairs up to the wall top and to the stores for 
this part of the wall.

Although they take many times longer to load and fire the a longbow the
range of the device is a 100 yards further, able to reach beyond the
front lines of an incatious enemy.

Small bunks, barely wide enough to lie in without rolling off the side

eighteen soldiers maintains each section of wall. Three groups of six 
soldiers, each working two of three shifts during a day for three days 
before a change in duty so none of the soldiers become complacent.

squashed against the walls. Two small doors, iron banded and with heavy

Mounted alongside the far wall looking out from the city is a large crossbow.
In times of need 2 or 3 soldiers would man the crossbow. One to aim the
device and another 1 or 2 ready to reload it as soon as a bolt is fired.
Although they take many times longer to load and fire the a longbow the
range of the device is a 100 yards further, able to reach beyond the
front lines of an incatious enemy.

below without exposing themselves to return fire. The walls are smooth

Walking along the wall you come along two young guards in a heated
argument. "No I tell you the Mayflower is THE place to visit" a small
weasly looking guard is telling a tall blonde warrior. "Bah! For
my taste nothing beats The Black Lotus.". "No! The girls at the Mayflower
have the largest ....". The two guards break off their 'discussion'
when they notice you. The tall warrior tells you to move along - unless
you want to be arrested for disturbing the peace - but his red face
spoils the stern look.

Looking out south-east over the farmlands surrounding the town, you can
see two farmers struggling to pull an uncooperative donkey towards the
city. Everytime one of the farmers gets a good grip the beast turns
around and tries to bite him, forcing him to back off. The sight has
several guards close by putting wagers on who will win in the end - the
farmers or the beast.

Stairs up~
A small set of stone stairs set within the wall will take you up to the 
top of the city wall. Next to the stairs are two doors, banded with iron 
and very thick. Glancing through the open doors you can see what appears 
to be quarters through one door, a small mess hall through the other.

Mess hall~
Built into the walls of the city, the mess hall is spartan. Every three 
days, the watch changes and there is nothing to say soldiers will serve 
at the same place along the wall again soon. A rough wooden bench and 
table are jammed into the room, with barely room to sit without been 
squashed against the walls. Two small doors, iron banded and with heavy 
locks lead out to the stairs up to the wall top and to the stores for 
this part of the wall.

Stacked neatly into the small storeroom are all the supplies for this

iron rations for the soldiers, sharpening stones for swords, straps and 
a dozen other small items laid out with military precision. Quite an 
arsenal has been packed into the limited space.

Small bunks, barely wide enough to lie in without rolling off the side

eighteen soldiers maintains each section of wall. Three groups of six 
soldiers, each working two of three shifts during a day for three days 
before a change in duty so none of the soldiers become complacent.

Passing through south-east gates~
Passing between the two large sets of gate - one on either side of the wall,
there is a small iron banded door to the east leading up to along the top
of the city wall. Along the roof are killing holes where archers could 
decimate any forces managing to breach the outer gates.

Inside SE gates~
Passing through the gates to the city within you are have to keep a close
eye about you to avoid been crushed by the crowds. Everywhere people are
going about their business - traders buying and selling goods, nobles
in their carriages on the way to balls, guards patrolling the streets,
beggars begging - from the mighty to the meek all are here - and all
seemingly oblivious to you.

Although they take many times longer to load and fire the a longbow the

Mess hall~
Built into the walls of the city, the mess hall is spartan. Every three 
days, the watch changes and there is nothing to say soldiers will serve 
at the same place along the wall again soon. A rough wooden bench and 
table are jammed into the room, with barely room to sit without been 
squashed against the walls. Two small doors, iron banded and with heavy 
locks lead out to the stairs up to the wall top and to the stores for 
this part of the wall.

iron rations for the soldiers, sharpening stones for swords, straps and 
a dozen other small items laid out with military precision. Quite an

Built into the walls of the city, the mess hall is spartan. Every three

at the same place along the wall again soon. A rough wooden bench and

squashed against the walls. Two small doors, iron banded and with heavy 
locks lead out to the stairs up to the wall top and to the stores for 
this part of the wall.

Wall~
Mounted alongside the far wall looking out from the city is a large crossbow.
In times of need 2 or 3 soldiers would man the crossbow. One to aim the
device and another 1 or 2 ready to reload it as soon as a bolt is fired.
Although they take many times longer to load and fire the a longbow the
range of the device is a 100 yards further, able to reach beyond the
front lines of an incatious enemy.

Sea wall~
Mounted along the sea wall is a large catapult, ready to hurl large boulders
at approaching ships. The device would be devastating enough on its own,
but some of the boulders have been enchanted by mages in the service of
the city to explode upon impact, greatly enhancing their destructive power.

Sea wall~
East towards the city you can see another sea - a sea of building covering
most of the ground within the city walls. The city is divided into two
parts, the outer city and the inner city, nestled at the foot of a 'curve'
in the mountain, protected along its southern edge by another wall. All
are welcome in the main part of the city, but the inner city contains
the wheels of government and homes of the cities nobles and the likes
of you aren't allowed entry without a gate pass.

Sea wall~
Standing on the sea wall, you can feel the cool breezes on your face and 
hear the crashes as the sea pounds into the wall protecting the harbour. 
To the west rough, choppy seas, water too turbulent to see beneath the 
surface. Within the harbour, clear seas, barely a ripple crossing the 
surface, allowing you to see deep into the harbour.

Along the sea wall, you look down and see a natural island almost covered

The gate fortress barracks troops and sailors for the cities warships.
It also guards the harbour mouth. Within the fortress itself is a mechanism
to raise a large chain across the harbour mouth, preventing all but the
smallest ships from entering or leaving the harbour.

Shouts and curses suddenly erupt from below and looking down you can see
two small fishing boats, each with two crew a piece jostling and arguing.
No one could ever accuse the fisherman of fine speech - insults are traded,
ancestory is called in question and suggestions to go perform clearly
humanely impossible acts with small animals are shouted back and forth
until one of the vessels manages to knock over the other and the laughing
guards along the docks turn serious and demand the two boats seperate.

Quarters~
Small bunks, barely wide enough to lie in without rolling off the side 
are stacked three high along either side of the wall. A compliment of 
eighteen soldiers maintains each section of wall. Three groups of six 
soldiers, each working two of three shifts during a day for three days 
before a change in duty so none of the soldiers become complacent.

Sea wall~
Up and down the docks are a hive of activity, ships moving in and out, 
traders haggling with merchants off of the ships, trying to look
uninterested enough to get the lowest price possible, but not let
the competition in. But don't you notice traders everywhere have poor
sick children they can barely afford to feed ?

Sea wall~
Looking out from the wall you can see ships docked along the many wharves
of the city, loading and unloading goods of trade. The docks never truly
shut down, the activity of ships been worked on during the day, replaced
by sailors drinking the night away, moving from pub to pub - or to the 
abodes of the ladies of the night.

Sea wall~
Set into the back of the sea wall stone stairs lead down into the sea wall 
itself. Back along the wall soldiers march up and down it's length, keeping 
their eyes cast out to see. Though they stand here to protect the city, they 
are concerned with ships heading in - not the harbour.

Sea wall~
The sea wall is as thick and strong as the rest of the walls around the 
city. Extending in part hundreds of feet below the waters surface there 
is only one gap for ocean going vessels moving in and out of the city.

Stairs up~
A small set of stone stairs set within the wall will take you up to the 
top of the city wall. Next to the stairs are two doors, banded with iron 
and very thick. Glancing through the open doors you can see what appears 
to be quarters through one door, a small mess hall through the other.

Mess hall~
Built into the walls of the city, the mess hall is spartan. Every three 
days, the watch changes and there is nothing to say soldiers will serve 
at the same place along the wall again soon. A rough wooden bench and 
table are jammed into the room, with barely room to sit without been 
squashed against the walls. Two small doors, iron banded and with heavy 
locks lead out to the stairs up to the wall top and to the stores for 
this part of the wall.

Stores~
Stacked neatly into the small storeroom are all the supplies for this 
portion of the cities walls. Small stores along the wall keep the speed
of any response to attack very quick. Neatly laid out quivers of arrows,
iron rations for the soldiers, sharpening stones for swords, straps and 
a dozen other small items laid out with military precision. Quite an 
arsenal has been packed into the limited space.

formed, with no way past without getting wet.

Moving out further away from the harbour mouth and city walls the guards
walking along the sea wall patrolling it get smaller and smaller. At this 
distance if you ran into trouble help would arrive too late to help you.

On the seas~
Alongside the enterance to the harbour you can see several small fishing
boats slowly making there way towards the open passage through the sea
wall. Within the harbour gentle waves barely ripple the deep blue waters,
the harbour is very deep. Several ships have sunk in their time, but
goods and most of the unfortunate crews have been saved by the merfolk
living on the bottom of the harbour.

On the seas~
Outside the harbour mouth you can travel into the cities great harbour or
venture out on the wide seas. Beyond the harbour mouth without the sea
wall to keep the seas calm the surf is rough and ship captains can't
afford to relax on the final run into the city - losing their cargo or
ship at the end of the journey wouldn't do any captains reputation good.

On the seas~
Passing between the Gate Fortress and the opposite side of the sea wall, 
the narrow passage through to the harbour is only wide enough for 2 or 3 
large ships to pass at a time. It keeps the harbourmaster busy scheduling 
traders in and out, but ensures the city is easily protected by attack 
from sea.

On the seas~
Moving round a corner in the sea wall you can see the harbour mouth to 
the north. A large trading vessel is riding the waves past the harbour
fortress with abandon. If theres another vessel coming from the other
direction there may be trouble.

The great sea wall around the harbour of Impulzarr curves around from the
east to the north here. Running your hand over the wall it is seemless, 
as smooth as glass, but as hard as iron.

Alongside the sea wall you can see the the ocean come up against high cliffs
to the east. Waves crash and pound against the cliffs, smashing with great
force. YOu would be pounded to a pulp by those waves.

On the seas~
At the edge of the water you are boxed in on two sides. To the north by the
wall around the city stretching up high above, to the east by a cliff face.
The strong ocean waves pound you against the cliff face, lifting you out
of the water and smashing you against the rocks.

yield to more 'civilised' means.

Center of ship~
Tied up alongside the small dock alongside the sea fortress, the small
warship is battered after been caught out at sea in a heavy storm. Workmen
swarm over the decks making repairs so the ship will soon be ready to chase
smugglers or pirates coming too close to the city.

Rising up out from the deck, the mast is fitted with rigging you can climb
up to the crows nest above. Though why you'd want to climb up to the crows
nest of a docked ship is another matter ....

Crows nest~
Looking out from the crows nest you can see the workmen scurrying on the 
deck below, making repairs. Out to the west no other vessels can be seen 
approaching the harbour. You can't see over the tall harbour wall, though 
you can see soldiers walking its length, dwarfed by the immense wall they 
patrol.
