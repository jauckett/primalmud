The Ornate Gates of Maalgor's Mansion~
Some gold-gilded gates lie just to the south of here,
and an impressive mansion lies just beyond them. There
is a small path winding its way through the gardens up
to the front door.

gate gates gold gilded~
The gates are rather ornate, and look fairly new, but would
not stop invaders from storming the mansion.

The Servants Communal Room~
Maalgor must want to keep his servants happy, for he has
ordered a games room constructed for them. Some servants
play cards against the far wall, others play a strange
game on a large table. The table is covered in green felt,
and they are using long sticks to hit shiny balls about.

The Front Door~
A creepy looking rope hangs to the side of the doors, and when
you pull it the doors swing open of their own accord. You step
into the cool luxury of inside. The floors are made of marble
and there are impressive pillars rising to the ceiling above.

The Bar~
A large bar sits on the north wall. Evidently this is where
Maalgor and his guests sit until dinner is served. There are
several guests with large round cups in their hands, apparently
relishing every drop.

The sevants are just setting the table now. Maalgor evidently
dines in style. The servants are setting the table with silver
cutlery, and fine crystal goblets.

SHHHH! There are people trying to sleep in here! You tip-toe
quietly in, and see several rows of beds. There are servants
lying on some of them, fast asleep.

The Reception Chamber~
A large flight of stairs wind up to who-knows-where, and a
din comes from the south, presumably the kitchen. There is
a sign to the east, mentioning that the way to the dining
hall lies that way.

A Tight Passage~
You guess Maalgor is of the mind that if you can't
fit through this passage, you should be on a diet
anyway. A faint yapping noise comes from the south.

The Wine Cellar~
It is slightly dank down here, perfect for letting
wines age undisturbed for years. Maalgor certainly
has quite a collection, do you think he'd notice just
one missing?

The Kitchens~
Organised madness is the only way to describe this room. Junior
chefs hurry from one oven to the next, checking on the roasts and
bread. Senior cooks work of delicate desserts and sumpious sauces.
The smell is enough to make your mouth water, and you think you
might be able to steal a spire off one of the dessert towers...

The yapping sound has grown louder, and there is an
intersection to the south. The walls have paintings
hanging from them and they look expensive.

Maalgor's Bedroom~
There is a fine four-poster bed in the centre of this room,
and tapestries hang from all the walls. The carpet is so
thick, you almost sink ankle deep in it. There are many
fine paintings and vases, all priceless.

The Kennels~
The yapping and barking sound is almost deafening in here.
Maalgor seems to like hunting, and this is where he breeds
his hunting dogs. Trophies line the walls, and you're sure
the dogs, know that if they don't perform as well as the
previous generation...CHOP!

An Intersection of Passages~
The yapping sound is coming from the west, and fine carpet
proclaims something interesting to the west. Back to the
north is that horrible, tight passage.

and a Keep Out sign on the door.

A millions reflections grin back at you, and your grip and reality

Good. You should be able to find that again.
