Entering the forest of Drielend.~
As you enter into the forest of Drielend you notice the large impressive oak
trees that shades the path. In these large trees timid animals peer back 
at you as they quickly dart behind the branches. If you look south you see 
a small shadey path that leads into the heart of Drielend forest. Looking 
up you see Darask road that leads back towards haven.

A shadey path.~
You are travelling along a shadey path. Large oak trees surround you from 
all sides blocking any possible path other than the one you are travelling 
along. You can hear small animals making chirping and chattering noises from the
trees that surround you, however it is difficult to catch a glimpse of 
them as they are extremely timid.

A shadey path.~
You are travelling along a shadey path where large oak trees and 
beuatiful wild flowers surround you from all sides. As you admire this 
calm peacefull place you hear the snarling of vicious wolves in the 
distance. You realise that although this beautiful forest looks harmless 
there are some animals who live in it that aren't quite so timid.

You are travelling along a shadey path where large, old oak trees surround 
you from all sides. You notice that the oak trees block your path forward 
and there is no other path other than the one you just travelled down.
As you stand here you hear the distant snarling of vicious wolves and 
wonder if the forest looks as safe as your originally thought it was.

Entering the forest of Drielend.~
As you enter the forest of Drielend you notice the large impressive oak
trees that shade the path. There are also huge fern trees that crowd 
around the path blocking any entrances through the forest. Peering 
through the trees are many small timid animals that look harmless. 
However in the distance you hear the howling and snarling of vicious 
wolves.

you can no longer see the sky above. The forest floor is covered in small 
wildflowers and soft green moss that feels soft and smooth under your 
feet. The smell of damp fresh earth is very destinct here as if the 
forest has just had a recent downpour of rain.

The floor of the forest is covered in soft moss that feels cool and 
soothing under your feet. Small timid animals dart in and out of the trees
that surround you, quickly glancing in your direction as they pass. In 
the distance you can hear the howling and snarling of a pack of vicious
wolves that make you very wary about travelling ahead.

Leaving Drielend.~
As you leaving the forest of Drielend the air becomes fresher and you no 
longer feel closed in by all those large oaks. You can smell a cool 
breeze gently cooling your face and a slight smell of salt is in the air. 
You think that there may be a lake or ocean nearby.

clothing to protect you from the sand as it stings your arms and legs as
it hits you. There is also a strange eerie whistling sound coming from 
the sand dunes but you don't think that is is simply the wind.
