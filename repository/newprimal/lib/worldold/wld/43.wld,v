The Brick house~
You are standing in a brick vaneer house.
This little piggy has no worries about a Big Bad Wolf blowing his house down.
This house has a large gas oven and ducted heating.  Large bay windows
with a view of the forest beyond.  A large dining table made out of teak 
and six chairs surround it.  There is a small keypad on the wall to
cover security of any unwanted visitors.  There are many trophies on the 
wall and pictures of a large pig standing over his many kills.

are purple with pink leaves. The fruit that grows on these trees is completel

You are in the Main Dining Room you have never seen such opulance.  There is
a long dining table that could sit over one hundred people at a guess.  The
table is coverd with delicasies from all over the world.  In the middle of
the table there is a large pig on a platter with a apple in its mouth.
Large gold goblets with monkey brains and ice cream are placed before the
guests and they dig in hungrily.

Large Iron Gate~
Here stands a Large Iron Gate.  Impossible to climb. You sense movement
coming from the round windows of the old factory.  However the windows are
just too dirty to make out a clear picture.  Although there is one thing you
know for sure.  The figures look almost human.  Leading from the gate is red
carpet going right upto the large wooden doors of the factory.  This seems
like the only way in.  You hear stange noises coming from the factory.

The Golden Hen House.~
You see a number of Oompa Lumpa's sitting at tables rapping the golden
chocolate eggs.  About the room are ribbons colored paper.  Stacked in
the corner are thousands of gift boxes used for the golden eggs to giftrap.
There is a Oompa Lumpa pushing a trolly filled with chocolate eggs.

The Golden Hen House.~
You have entered a large indoor hen house.  On the walls there are large
nests and as you look around the room a Goose lays an egg.  The egg rolls
down a shoot and onto a large scale.  At this point a arrow on a scale
points to the word "Good" and the egg roles down to a Oompa Lumpa who
picks the egg up and carry's it to a table and begins to polish it.
Then another egg is layed and rolls down the shoot.  However this time
the arrow points to bad and the egg dissapears down to the furnace.

You are lucky enough not to be burnt to a crisp since the furnace is only
lit every other day.  So you had a good fighting chance.

In the spa!~
You are soaking your tired bones in a comfortably warm spa.  Steam fills
your nostrils.  You can feel all your muscles relaxing.  Just what was needed
after a long days adventuring.

The Giant Beanstalk~
You are climbing a large beanstalk.  It seems to have grown out of no where.  
This seems like a very unlikely place for anything to grow let alone a
beanstalk of this magnitude.

The Giant Beanstalk~
You are climbing up the large beanstalk.  You cannot see the top as it is 
blocked by a layer of silvery cloud.  As you look down you see the base 
of the beanstalk and a small covering of clouds that surround it.

Just Below the Silvery Clouds~
You are climbing the large beanstalk.  You dare not look down as you are quite 
high.  You are approaching the large silvery clouds. You wonder at what you 
could find at the top of the large beanstalk.

In the Silvery Clouds~
You have entered the silvery clouds.  You imagine this is what heaven would be
like.  However you can  not see a metre in front of you and am not quite sure
of what is awaiting you at the top.

Above the Silvery Clouds~
You are climbing the large beanstalk.  You are above the Silvery clouds and
can see further up a road made of yellow bricks.  Where on earth can you 
possible be? The yellow brick road seems to be paved with gold and the light
at the top of the beanstalk is clearer and brighter than any you have 
ever seen.
