"GUARDIANS OF JUSTICE"

Long ago when the tyranny of The Avengers reigned supreme over the land, it was
a dark and evil place. Moe, the leader of The Avengers was a cruel tyrant, 
feared by all the newbies. For when he would become bored, this terrible king 
would take up arms, and lay waste to new players everywhere. Thus he was dubbed
The Butcher. 

There also existed two smaller clans. The Primal Knights, and The Astral 
Wraiths. They both suffered under the curse of Moe, until one day, they could 
bear it no more. Being too small to fight the Avengers individually, they 
united to form a tough but short lived clan called The Astral Knights, but due 
to the lies and deception of Moe, our numbers slowly dwindled into a handful of
loyal members. Not to be discouraged, we took our small army, and passed 
ourselves off as clanless fighters, so The Evil One would not watch us.

Finally the day came. We threw off our masks of clanlessness, and rose once more
as The Guardians of Justice! Since then, we have remained one of the two major 
clans of the mud, and a force to be reckoned with. A while after the clan was 
formed, Raistlin was reincarnated as the god Moridin. He is no longer a clan 
leader, but supports us in spirit, and we pay our respects to him. 

The current leaders of the clan are Dracion, Roj, and Tarn. If you are a 
Guardian, and have been attacked by an opposing clan, these are the people you 
should speak to. Essentially, The Guardians of Justice are the watchdogs of the
mud, and will defend the innocent and helpless against Moe's army of darkness. 
All you need do is call, and a Guardian will help.



                         FOR THE HONOUR OF ODIN


                          FOR THE GLORY OF WAR


                    FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INNOCENT


                      FIGHT TO THE DEATH GUARDIANS!

KNIGHT

If you become a knight within a clan this gives you the right to
recruit for your clan.  If you successfully recruit someone and
they wish to join the clan you belong to simply get them to type 
signup and then you may recruit them.

"ROSE CLUB"
The clan of rOsE cLuB have not supplied us with a list
of the requirements and obligations needed to join this clan
#
JEDI

The Jedi's were formed by the mighty Kodiak and ruled by him up until his 
passing to the afterlife, where he now sits and watches over all that become
members of the Jedi Clan. 

We are a peaceful but forceful and powerful presence within the realms of 
Primalmud. We now carry on the traditions that where set down by the mighty 
who have previously ruled over us and never faulter under the pressure of our 
foes. We are the last front in the line of the resistance and would rather give
our lives than let the evil emporer win us over and convert us to the ways of 
the evil empire that he rules. We stand vigilantly wether as one or as a group 
and defend the clan and it's beleifs at all times. In assistance of fighting 
the emporer and his evil ways we have formed an allegiance with the avengers 
and have agreed to assist them as they have agreed to assist us in a variety 
of conquests that arise from time to time.

Whilst we are a peaceful clan we strongly oppose those who wish to continue 
with their unjustices towards others and will assist any person in need of it 
and punish those who stand in the way of our goals.
