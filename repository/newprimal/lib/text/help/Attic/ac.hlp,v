"AC" is your armor class.  It is a number from -10 to 10, roughly
defined as follows:

  10 Naked person
   0 Very Heavily armored (Plate mail, and "two shields") 
 -10 Armored battle tank

The score command displays your armor class as a number such as 78/10;
this means 78 on a scale from -100 to 100 (i.e., 7.8 on the scale from
-10 to 10.)
