@RACE

The race system used in PrimalMUD allows for a wider range of character
statistics than that of the 4 'class' system used earlier. The races that
a character can be are:

       RACE       STR CON DEX INT WIS CHA
[ 1]  Ogre        21  21  14  16  16  11
[ 2]  Deva        16  16  18  21  21  19

Type 'help <race>' for help on any specific race, ie:

DWARF DWARVES DWARFS

&2Dwarf&n

Stocky and powerful, dwarves make excellent warriors, aided by their legendary 
constitution, they are amongst the most effective indoor fighters, able to use 
their small stature to maximal potency.

Spending much of their time indoors has allowed them to develop the ability to 
see in the dark at all times.

Their main talent however, lies in their ability to navigate underground, and 
escape from the most unlikely of places, leading themselves and their allies to 
safe shelter.


&2Extra Abilities&n
-------------------
&3Enhanced Thief Abilities
Escape
Indoor battle bonus&n
#
ELF ELFS ELVES

&2Elf&n

Lithe yet strong, Elves are versatile beings most at home in Forested areas. 
Because of their affinity with nature, many Elves become Druids at some stage 
of their existance, as a way of giving back to nature in return for the gifts 
it has bestowed upon them.

Their prowess in Forests is legendary, and their eyesight so keen that it can 
penetrate the night. With their affinity with the land they are able to see 
a path were no other can see one!


&2Extra Abilities&n
-------------------
&3Permanant Infravision
Tracker
Forest battle bonus&n
#
HUMAN HUMANS 

&2Human&n

Not cursed with strange mutated abilities, Humans are the pure stock of the 
land. They are most able to adapt to new situations, and advance the fastest 
as they do not have any hampering skills to develop, on their way to supremacy.


&2Extra Abilities&n
-------------------
&3None&n

#
MINOTAUR MINOTAURS

&2Minotaur&n

Tall and muscular, these brutes are reputed to be a mix of Bull and Man. Horned 
bull-like heads on top of broad shouldered human bodies intimidate even the
staunchest of opponents.

Furious in battle, and extraordinarily strong, their horns are vicious and 
tearing, often brutalising enemies. Their focus on battle gives them an edge,
and their barbaric strength lends their weapons extra damage.


&2Extra Abilities&n
-------------------
&3Gore attack
Battle damage bonus&n

#
OGRE OGRES

&2Ogre&n

Large and warty, Ogres are muscular brutes with a greenly tinged skin colour, 
similar to that of Orcs, whom they are said to be distantly related to.

Ogres are brutish unthinking killing machines, concerned with muscular 
development which they have mastered even from a young age. They are not mad
uncontrolled berserkers in battle, as Minotaurs are, but they are able to 
inflict more damage with their weapons of choice than most other creatures.

Their hide is a thick skin, which resists all attempts to pierce it, to the 
extent of making them much more impervious to physical attacks. The only
downfall of an ogre is he can never find a pair of gloves big enough for 
him to wear on his enormous hands, Rings however are expandable to fit his
brutish size!

 
&2Extra Abilities&n

&3Brutish Strength
Brutish Constitution

Battle damage bonus&n

#
PIXIE PIXIES

&2Pixie&n

Flighty and small, Pixies are a wonder to behold.

Beautiful creatures, full of grace and life, they have small wings on their 
backs which can easily lift them above the troubles of the world. 

Their unearthly eyes penetrate the dark at all times, and their bodies are such 
that they can channel powerful magics if they are so inclined.

Being a forest creature, other forest creatures are allies, and when faced with 
danger inside a Forested area, it is not uncommon to see their allies come out 
to aid them against their foes.

DEVA DEVAS

&2Deva&n

Mysterous in nature nobody really knows what a Deva looks like! 

The only thing known about them is they have incredibly sensitive
ears in which they refuse to put anything on!

In addition to these race statistic modifiers, a player can select what order
their statistics are assigned dice rolls. The primary statistics are based on
3d6 rolls which approximate a  standard bell curve, representing the
ditribution within a population.

METHOD:
  1. The player chooses two stats and take best 3 of 8d6, re-rolling 1's
  2. The player choooses two remaining stats and take best of 4d6, re-roll 1's
  3. Roll 3d6 for remaining stats, re-roll 1's
  4. Higher rolls in [2] or [3] take precedence over lower rolls in [1] or [2]

To make this selection, there are 4 presets for statistic order, plus an option
  to select them manually. These options are:

KENDA

Small of stature, but quicker than humanly possible,
Kenda tend to be thought of as pests. For those Kenda
able to supress their urges toward flightiness, life
has become very lucrative. 

Rightfully so, they are frequently suspected of being
at the centre of most daring crimes. Their thieving 
abilities are instinctive, and are - even at their worst,
a step above others.

Their slight built and sneaky nature also means that 
people rarely notice them going around on their own
business. Much to their chargrin.

Although average in most ways, almost in a mimic
of human attributes, they have the uncanny ability
to charm fellow demi-humans into joining their cause.

Completely inexplicably, previously aggressive

even unto death.
