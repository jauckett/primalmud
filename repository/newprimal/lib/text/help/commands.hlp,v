@AFFECTS

&2Affects&n

&3Usage:&n &4affects&n

An affect is something that modifies your attributes.
These are usually made active on you by casting spells or using skills.

This command displays all of your current affects, at level 20 the
amount of information displayed is increased.
#
ALIAS ALIASES

&2Alias or Aliases&n

&3Usage:&n &4alias [<alias name>] [command]&n

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The &4ALIAS&n command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
&4ALIAS&n alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.
The &3<alias name>&n must be one word.  The &3command&n can be any string.  
Aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  Any command may be overridden 
by an alias (other than the &4ALIAS&n command itself, of course).

  > &4alias gbb get bread bag&n
  > &4alias gac get all corpse&n

Type &4alias <alias-name>&n to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > &4alias gbb&n

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias. 
(Note a semicolon may be interpreted differently as "input" in some clients)

  > &4alias eat get bread bag; eat bread&n

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables &3$1, $2, ... $9&n may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > &4alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2&n
  > &4killem fido mage&n

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > &4alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1&n

The special variable &3$*&n represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > &4alias tr tell rasmussen $*&n
  > &4tr hi there, how are you today?&n
  &rYou tell &7Rasmussen&r, 'hi there, how are you today?'&n

#
ANSI COLOUR COLOR
&2"Ansi Colour"&n

&3Usage:&n &4colour [off | sparse | normal | complete]&n

If you have a colour-capable terminal and wish to see useful colour-coding
of information, use the &4colour&n command to set the level of colouring you see.
These four subcommands turn colour on && off to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

'&4colour&n' with no argument will display your current colour level.

Using colour will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticeable on slower connections.  Even if you have
colour turned on, non-colourised messages will not be slowed down at all.

&RPrimalMUD&n implements &rEasy Colour v2.2&n, which interprets inline colour codes.
Colours can be displayed in your text by inserting a &3&&&n followed by a &3<char code>&n.

The &3<char codes>&n correspond to the following colours:
&rr	Red&n 		&gg	Green&n 	
&yy	Yellow&n		&bb	Blue&n
&mm	Magenta&n 	&cc	Cyan&n
&ww	White&n
&RR	Bold Red&n 	&GG	Bold Green&n
&YY	Bold Yellow&n 	&BB	Bold Blue&n
&MM	Bold Magenta&n 	&CC	Bold Cyan&n
&WW	Bold White&n

Additionally, there are a number of special codes including:
&nn	Normal&n	
&vv	Reverse&n	
&uu	Underline&n
[	Set mark&n	]	Colour of set mark&n

example:
  > &4gossip &&[I am feeling a bit &&GSICK&&] today!&n
            ^ 			       ^    	
          colour                   changes
	 here is  		  to colour
	  yellow  	      at last mark (&&[ = yellow)
              \/                      \/
  &yYou gossip, 'I am feeling a bit &[&GSICK&] today!'

#
"ASSIST"

&2"Assist"&n

&3Usage:&n &4assist <person in need>&n

If &7Quifael&n is being beaten senseless by a &6warg&n and you feel brave enough

#
"REPORTING SYSTEM"

&2Reporting System&n

&RPrimalMUD&n version 3 saw the implementation of a new reporting system.
This report management system allows players to use a menu based system to 
add information about the &4bug&n/&4typo&n/&4idea&n/&4todo&n report. It is designed to provide
better communication over the tradition &4bug&n/&4typo&n/&4idea&n commands which logs
the text directly to file which usually ends up being ignored.

&3Lifecycle&n
&3---------&n
Initially when a report is created, the state is set to &3OPEN&n. When the
responsible person looks at the report, they should edit it and change the
state to &3ASSESSED&n (so the reporter knows the report has been looked at).
The responsible person should then fix/respond to the problem and change
the state to &3FEEDBACK&n. The reporter then verifies the fix/responce and
edits the report changing the state to &3CLOSED&n. Obvious exceptions apply to
a more complicated report, but the state principals as mentioned above
should be used consistantly as described.

Reports which have the &3DELETED&n state are still kept in file, but are not
visible from within the game.

&3Notification&n
&3------------&n
Every time that a report is modified, notification is given to the involved
parties (all people that have made a change to the initial report). This
notification is in the form of mudmail and includes the change description
as well information on how to view the entire details.

&3Restrictions&n
&3------------&n
Various restrictions have been put into the reporting system to ensure that
the system runs smoothly and as intended (holds appropiate privacy).

There are some restrictions that apply when using the report editor, but the
main restriction that apply on report usage are as follows:

Command      	list/print                      edit/delete
-------		----------			-----------
&3BUG&n          	<  GOD - owned reports          <  GRGOD - owned reports
		>= GOD - all reports            >= GRGOD - all reports

&3IDEA&n         	<  ANGEL - owned reports        <  GRGOD - owned reports
		>= ANGEL - all reports          >= GRGOD - all reports

&3TYPO&n         	<  IMMORT - owned reports       <  GOD - owned reports
              	>= IMMORT - all reports         >= GOD - all reports

&3TODO&n         	<  ANGEL - owned reports        <  GRGOD - owned reports
		>= ANGEL - all reports          >= GRGOD - all reports

following you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group.  Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command.  The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

  Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

  Quifael : "follow dragon"
  Redferne: "follow dragon"
  (Dragon should be following no one but himself)
  Dragon  : "group dragon"
  Dragon  : "group redferne"
  Dragon  : "group quifael"

&2Split&n

&3Usage:&n &4split <amount>&n

room as you.  If you are in a group with 4 other people, all of whom are in

#
TIME MOON

&2Time Moon&n

&3Usage:&n &4time
       moon&n

TIME gives you the current game time.  Your initial reaction to the output of
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.

MOON gives you the current moon in orbit.

#
TIMER TIMERS

&2timer timers&n

This is how we keep track of the n usage per t ticks..
Timers will show you a list of what you have used and when you can 
use it again.
#
TITLE

&2Title&n

&3Usage:&n &4title <new title>&n

Sets the title people see on the WHO list and when you're in the room with
them.  You can't use parentheses (the "(" and ")" characters) because those
are reserved for flags.

Do not abuse this command; if you do, it will be taken from you.

#
TOGGLE

&2Toggle&n

&3Usage:&n &4toggle&n

TOGGLE shows you the current values of various toggles available on the MUD.

#
USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

&2Use Wand Staff&n

&3Usage:&n &4use <staff>
       use <wand> <Target>&n

Using a staff will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, except yourself.  Therefore staffs are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.

Both staffs and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to use!  (Use the
grab or hold commands).  You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

AFFECTS

&2Affects&n

&3Usage:&n &4affects&n

An affect is something that modifies your attributes.
These are usually made active on you by casting spells or using skills.

This command displays all of your current affects, at level 20 the
amount of information displayed is increased.
#
ALIAS ALIASES

&2Alias or Aliases&n

&3Usage:&n &4alias [<alias name>] [command]&n

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The &4ALIAS&n command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
&4ALIAS&n alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.
The &3<alias name>&n must be one word.  The &3command&n can be any string.  
Aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  Any command may be overridden 
by an alias (other than the &4ALIAS&n command itself, of course).

  > &4alias gbb get bread bag&n
  > &4alias gac get all corpse&n

Type &4alias <alias-name>&n to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > &4alias gbb&n

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias. 
(Note a semicolon may be interpreted differently as "input" in some clients)

  > &4alias eat get bread bag; eat bread&n

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables &3$1, $2, ... $9&n may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > &4alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2&n
  > &4killem fido mage&n

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > &4alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1&n

The special variable &3$*&n represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > &4alias tr tell rasmussen $*&n
  > &4tr hi there, how are you today?&n
  &rYou tell &7Rasmussen&r, 'hi there, how are you today?'&n

#
ANSI COLOUR COLOR
&2"Ansi Colour"&n

&3Usage:&n &4colour [off | sparse | normal | complete]&n

If you have a colour-capable terminal and wish to see useful colour-coding
of information, use the &4colour&n command to set the level of colouring you see.
These four subcommands turn colour on && off to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

'&4colour&n' with no argument will display your current colour level.

Using colour will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticeable on slower connections.  Even if you have
colour turned on, non-colourised messages will not be slowed down at all.

&RPrimalMUD&n implements &rEasy Colour v2.2&n, which interprets inline colour codes.
Colours can be displayed in your text by inserting a &3&&&n followed by a &3<char code>&n.

The &3<char codes>&n correspond to the following colours:
&rr	Red&n 		&gg	Green&n 	
&yy	Yellow&n		&bb	Blue&n
&mm	Magenta&n 	&cc	Cyan&n
&ww	White&n
&RR	Bold Red&n 	&GG	Bold Green&n
&YY	Bold Yellow&n 	&BB	Bold Blue&n
&MM	Bold Magenta&n 	&CC	Bold Cyan&n
&WW	Bold White&n

Additionally, there are a number of special codes including:
&nn	Normal&n	
&vv	Reverse&n	
&uu	Underline&n
[	Set mark&n	]	Colour of set mark&n

example:
  > &4gossip &&[I am feeling a bit &&GSICK&&] today!&n
            ^ 			       ^    	
          colour                   changes
	 here is  		  to colour
	  yellow  	      at last mark (&&[ = yellow)
              \/                      \/
  &yYou gossip, 'I am feeling a bit &[&GSICK&] today!'

&2"Assist"&n

&3Usage:&n &4assist <person in need>&n

#
"REPORTING SYSTEM"

&2Reporting System&n

&RPrimalMUD&n version 3 saw the implementation of a new reporting system.
This report management system allows players to use a menu based system to 
add information about the &4bug&n/&4typo&n/&4idea&n/&4todo&n report. It is designed to provide
better communication over the tradition &4bug&n/&4typo&n/&4idea&n commands which logs
the text directly to file which usually ends up being ignored.

&3Lifecycle&n
&3---------&n
Initially when a report is created, the state is set to &3OPEN&n. When the
responsible person looks at the report, they should edit it and change the
state to &3ASSESSED&n (so the reporter knows the report has been looked at).
The responsible person should then fix/respond to the problem and change
the state to &3FEEDBACK&n. The reporter then verifies the fix/responce and
edits the report changing the state to &3CLOSED&n. Obvious exceptions apply to
a more complicated report, but the state principals as mentioned above
should be used consistantly as described.

Reports which have the &3DELETED&n state are still kept in file, but are not
visible from within the game.

&3Notification&n
&3------------&n
Every time that a report is modified, notification is given to the involved
parties (all people that have made a change to the initial report). This
notification is in the form of mudmail and includes the change description
as well information on how to view the entire details.

&3Restrictions&n
&3------------&n
Various restrictions have been put into the reporting system to ensure that
the system runs smoothly and as intended (holds appropiate privacy).

There are some restrictions that apply when using the report editor, but the
main restriction that apply on report usage are as follows:

Command      	list/print                      edit/delete
-------		----------			-----------
&3BUG&n          	<  GOD - owned reports          <  GRGOD - owned reports
		>= GOD - all reports            >= GRGOD - all reports

&3IDEA&n         	<  ANGEL - owned reports        <  GRGOD - owned reports
		>= ANGEL - all reports          >= GRGOD - all reports

&3TYPO&n         	<  IMMORT - owned reports       <  GOD - owned reports
              	>= IMMORT - all reports         >= GOD - all reports

&3TODO&n         	<  ANGEL - owned reports        <  GRGOD - owned reports
		>= ANGEL - all reports          >= GRGOD - all reports

BUY

&2Buy&n

       buy #<item number>
       buy n.<item name>
       buy n <item name>
       buy n #<item number>&n

If you'd like to purchase an item from a shop and have the money, you can buy
it.  Items can be bought by name, or by their number in the shop listing,
and can be bought in quantity.
 
Examples:
 
  > buy sword        (buy the first sword on the list)
  > buy #3           (buy the third item on the list)
  > buy 4.sword      (buy the fourth sword on the list)
  > buy 10 bread     (buy 10 pieces of bread)
  > buy 10 #2        (buy 10 of the second item on the list)

&3Usage:&n &4save&n

Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.

game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

#

class and race will receive on the spells/skills. You only need to
type either skillinfo or spellinfo and they will bring up the same 
listing.  Anything listed in red is completely unobtainable for the
combination of class and race you have selected.  This is also a 
handy tool when deciding what you want to remort too as you will see
what skills and spells you will receive on each remort class.

If you are wanting particular information on a spell or skill alone 
the usage would be:

&4skillinfo (spellinfo) <'spell/skill name'> <race>&n

classes that are in red are the ones that will not get the spell/skill.

       moon&n

TIME gives you the current game time.  Your initial reaction to the output of
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.

MOON gives you the current moon in orbit.

&3Usage:&n &4use <staff>
       use <wand> <Target>&n

Using a staff will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, except yourself.  Therefore staffs are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.

Both staffs and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to use!  (Use the
grab or hold commands).  You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

       wear <item> <location>&n

people) you can type "wear all".

AFFECTS

&2Affects&n

&1Usage:&n &4affects&n

An affect is something that modifies your attributes.
These are usually made active on you by casting spells or using skills.

This command displays all of your current affects, at level 20 the
amount of information displayed is increased.
#
ALIAS ALIASES

&2Alias or Aliases&n

&1Usage:&n &4alias [<alias name>] [command]&n

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The &4ALIAS&n command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
&4ALIAS&n alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.
The &3<alias name>&n must be one word.  The &3command&n can be any string.  
Aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  Any command may be overridden 
by an alias (other than the &4ALIAS&n command itself, of course).

  > &4alias gbb get bread bag&n
  > &4alias gac get all corpse&n

Type &4alias <alias-name>&n to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > &4alias gbb&n

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias. 
(Note a semicolon may be interpreted differently as "input" in some clients)

  > &4alias eat get bread bag; eat bread&n

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables &3$1, $2, ... $9&n may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > &4alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2&n
  > &4killem fido mage&n

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > &4alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1&n

The special variable &3$*&n represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > &4alias tr tell rasmussen $*&n
  > &4tr hi there, how are you today?&n
  &rYou tell &7Rasmussen&r, 'hi there, how are you today?'&n

#
ANSI COLOUR COLOR

&2"Ansi Colour"&n

&1Usage:&n &4colour [off | sparse | normal | complete]&n

If you have a colour-capable terminal and wish to see useful colour-coding
of information, use the &4colour&n command to set the level of colouring you see.
These four subcommands turn colour on && off to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

'&4colour&n' with no argument will display your current colour level.

Using colour will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticeable on slower connections.  Even if you have
colour turned on, non-colourised messages will not be slowed down at all.

&RPrimalMUD&n implements &rEasy Colour v2.2&n, which interprets inline colour codes.
Colours can be displayed in your text by inserting a &3&&&n followed by a &3<char code>&n.

The &3<char codes>&n correspond to the following colours:
&rr	Red&n 		&gg	Green&n 	
&yy	Yellow&n		&bb	Blue&n
&mm	Magenta&n 	&cc	Cyan&n
&ww	White&n

&RR	Bold Red&n 	&GG	Bold Green&n
&YY	Bold Yellow&n 	&BB	Bold Blue&n
&MM	Bold Magenta&n 	&CC	Bold Cyan&n
&WW	Bold White&n

Additionally, there are a number of special codes including:
&nn	Normal&n	
&@@f	Flash&n
&vv	Reverse&n	
&uu	Underline&n
[	Set mark&n	]	Colour of set mark&n

example:
  > &4gossip &&[I am feeling a bit &&GSICK&&] today!&n
            ^ 			       ^    	
          colour                   changes
	 here is  		  to colour
	  yellow  	      at last mark (&&[ = yellow)
              \/                      \/
  &yYou gossip, 'I am feeling a bit &[&GSICK&] today!'

"ASSIST"

&2"Assist"&n

"REPORTING SYSTEM"

&2Reporting System&n

&RPrimalMUD&n version 3 saw the implementation of a new reporting system.
This report management system allows players to use a menu based system to 
add information about the &4bug&n/&4typo&n/&4idea&n/&4todo&n report. It is designed to provide
better communication over the tradition &4bug&n/&4typo&n/&4idea&n commands which logs
the text directly to file which usually ends up being ignored.

&3Lifecycle&n
&3---------&n
Initially when a report is created, the state is set to &3OPEN&n. When the
responsible person looks at the report, they should edit it and change the
state to &3ASSESSED&n (so the reporter knows the report has been looked at).
The responsible person should then fix/respond to the problem and change
the state to &3FEEDBACK&n. The reporter then verifies the fix/responce and
edits the report changing the state to &3CLOSED&n. Obvious exceptions apply to
a more complicated report, but the state principals as mentioned above
should be used consistantly as described.

Reports which have the &3DELETED&n state are still kept in file, but are not
visible from within the game.

&3Notification&n
&3------------&n
Every time that a report is modified, notification is given to the involved
parties (all people that have made a change to the initial report). This
notification is in the form of mudmail and includes the change description
as well information on how to view the entire details.

&3Restrictions&n
&3------------&n
Various restrictions have been put into the reporting system to ensure that
the system runs smoothly and as intended (holds appropiate privacy).

There are some restrictions that apply when using the report editor, but the
main restriction that apply on report usage are as follows:

Command      	list/print                      edit/delete
-------		----------			-----------
&3BUG&n          	<  GOD - owned reports          <  GRGOD - owned reports
		>= GOD - all reports            >= GRGOD - all reports

&3IDEA&n         	<  ANGEL - owned reports        <  GRGOD - owned reports
		>= ANGEL - all reports          >= GRGOD - all reports

&3TYPO&n         	<  IMMORT - owned reports       <  GOD - owned reports
              	>= IMMORT - all reports         >= GOD - all reports

&3TODO&n         	<  ANGEL - owned reports        <  GRGOD - owned reports
		>= ANGEL - all reports          >= GRGOD - all reports

blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command.  The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

  Quifael : "follow dragon"
  Redferne: "follow dragon"
  (Dragon should be following no one but himself)
  Dragon  : "group dragon"
  Dragon  : "group redferne"

&3Usage:&n &4save&n

Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

#
SAY TELL ASK WHISPER SHOUT YELL HOLLER '

&2Tell Ask Whisper Shout Yell Holler&n

If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood

broadcasts to everyone in the game but costs 20 movement points.  You must
be level 2 before you can use shout and yell.

&3Usage:&n &4<social>
       <social> <victim>&n

actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages.  Generally,
social commands are used only to express emotion, but it is possible that
some mobs (or players) will take action based on the social.

Example:
  > shake homer
  > applaud marge
  > stare 

The SOCIALS command generates a canonical listing of all available socials.

See also: FOLLOW, GROUP
#
TIME MOON

&2Time Moon&n

&3Usage:&n &4time
       moon&n

TIME gives you the current game time.  Your initial reaction to the output of
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.

MOON gives you the current moon in orbit.

#
TITLE

&2Title&n

&3Usage:&n &4title <new title>&n

Sets the title people see on the WHO list and when you're in the room with
them.  You can't use parentheses (the "(" and ")" characters) because those

See also: FLAGS, WHO
#
TOGGLE

&2Toggle&n

USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

&2Use Wand Staff&n

&3Usage:&n &4use <staff>
       use <wand> <Target>&n

Using a staff will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, except yourself.  Therefore staffs are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.

Both staffs and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to use!  (Use the
grab or hold commands).  You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

       wear <item> <location>&n

Thief only.
d124 4
a127 3
Backstab is a way to sneak up on a person and attempt to place your dagger
in his back, at exactly the point where it does most damage.  A successful
backstab gives a damage multiplier, depending on level:
d129 2
a130 6
    Levels  Multiplier

    21-30       5
d132 1

have practiced backstab at your guild.  You can always backstab sleeping
people.

BASH

Fighters only.

The success of a bash depends upon how well you are learned.  To bash someone
is to attempt to 'knock' that person over.  If you succeed you will inflict
minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on it's rear.  The victim will be
unable to issue any commands for 2 rounds of violence.  If you miss you loose
your balance and fall.

A bash makes you unable to type commands for 2 rounds of violence.

HIDE

Thieves Only.

When you type hide there is a chance that you hide in the room.  If hidden
you can only be "sensed" by the "sense life" spell.  Even if sensed your
identity will remain hidden.  Hide is broken by pressing return, regardless
of whether you typed a command or not.

Example:

  > hide
  Ok.
  >  (you wait for ex. 5 mins and remain hidden for 5 mins)

  >  (You pressed enter and no longer hide)

Usage: kick <victim>

The success of a kick depends upon how well you are learned.  The higher
level you reach the harder you kick.  There is one small catch -- whenever
you kick (or miss) you will be unable to type any command for three 
rounds of 'Violence' -- so be sure that you do not need to flee!

STEAL

Thief Only.

Usage: steal <item> <victim>

Use steal to steal gold or items from people.  The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, and if the person
is asleep.

Due to misuse of the steal command, it is now illegal to steal from other
players.  Doing so will get you a flag for your trouble.

Examples:

    (If it's wielded, only possible if he is sleeping)
