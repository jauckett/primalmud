&2remort&n

This base has introduced a remort function.  Players are able to play
their character up to level 50 then take on the option to tranform
their character into something better.  There are four base classes
being: Cleric, Magician, Thief and Warrior.  These can be transformed
into the following 1st remort characters: Druid, Priest, Nightblade
Battlemage, Spellsword and Paladin.  From there you can play your 
improved character to the second and final remort stage at Level 75.

At this level there is only one choice Master.  Master has everything
available to him or her.  From here you can play your character right
through to level 100.
