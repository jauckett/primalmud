@AC

&2AC&n

"AC" is your &2armor class&n.  It is a number from -10 to 10, roughly
defined as follows:

  10 Naked person
   0 Very Heavily armored (Plate mail, and "two shields") 
 -10 Armored battle tank

The score command displays your &2armor class&n as a number such as &378/10&n;
this means 78 on a scale from -100 to 100 (i.e., 7.8 on the scale from
-10 to 10.)

ALIGNMENT

&2ALIGNMENT&n

Your alignment is a measure of how good or evil you are.  This is a
number between &r-1000&n and &c1000&n, the greater the number, the more Good you
are.  If you drop below -350, you will be &rEvil&n, and will have a &rRed Aura&n
to those with Detect Alignment.  If you rise above 350, you will be
&cGood&n, and will have a &cBlue aura&n.

Some items require you to be either &cGood&n, &rEvil&n, or &WNeutral&n, before you
can use them.
#
ANGEL

&2ANGEL&n

&cAngels&n are players who should be held in high respect by all players.

They are here to help newbies, hold quests and help with the general
running of Primal Mud. 

*To become an &cAngel&n you need to reach the level of champion then you have
to contribute more than simply playing time. If you are interested in
becoming an &cAngel&n talk to one of the &YGod's&n about this.

BOARDS

&2Boards&n

Bulletin boards are the forum of interplayer communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type &4"LOOK BOARD"&n to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
&4"WRITE <subject>"&n to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a &4'@@ or /s'&n as the first character on a new line.  Type &4"READ <number>"&n 
to read a post.  Type &4"REMOVE <number>"&n to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > look at board
  > write Am I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@@ or/s']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6
#
CASINO

&2Casino&n

The Primal Casino is located adjacent to the Tavern.
It was implemented by the benevolent but oft misunderstood
God &1Talisman&n.
It's only purpose is to releive players of their hard earned
coin. Good luck.

NOTE: Talisman is also famous for his Tali_procs.

#
CHANGE

&2Change&n

This command will force your character to change into the werewolf or
vampire if infected by either of them.  The change command can only be
used at night so one would have to use the TIME command to keep track
of when night is.  Also the MOON command would have to be monitored as you 
can not change on a moonless night.

#
CHANNELS

&2Channels&n

Primal Mud has a wide range of channels you can talk on
Some of these channels are visible by all players, some are more private.
This is a rough list and guide to how you can communicate on Primal

#
CHAMPION

&2Champion&n

Champion is the final level you can reach at primal by fighting mobs.
At reaching champion you may still kill mobs and players as well as 
obtaining a few extra advantages.
To advance to an Angel you need to contribute more than just playing time.
The Gods make a final decision on whether you are worthy to become
an angel so you need to show true Champion qualities first.
#

you can find! Then go back to the jewelers and cash them all in!

GHOST

As a newbie you may experience mobs that are slightly tougher than 
yourself and can bring death to your door! When you do die in the 
game as a newbie you will find yourself sent back to the 
Riverside Tavern where you are resting, you will also have a "ghost" 
flag next to  your name in the who list.  Whilst being a ghost you 
will not be able to attack anything until you are fully restored to 
max hitpoints.  Once this has been done the "ghost" flag will 
automatically remove from your name and you will be able to continue 
fighting.

HOUSES

&2Houses&n

A house entails two things: access control and crash protection. 
Only you and your guests will be allowed to enter the house.  
Your house will be crash-saved every five minutes.  You can force 
your house to save by typing 'save' while standing in your house.
In the event of a crash, the objects in your house as of the last crash-save
will be loaded back into your house when the MUD reboots.  Also, if you own
a house, and quit from the game while standing in your house, you will be
loaded into your house next time you enter the game.

Guests of your house can be defined using the HOUSE command.  See HOUSE for
more information.

Houses are an alternative to renting.  You can simply enter your house,
drop your items, and type 'quit', and everything in your house
will be saved for you to retrieve on your return.
There is currently a 50 object limit which can be stored in your house.
Of course, players must expect to pay a much higher premium for
the convenience of houses;

Contact Sandii via mudmail for the purchace of a house.

HOUSE OPTIONS AND PRICE LIST
 
40 Million up front and a minimum level of 30 - one room 50 items

Extra 40 Million for additional rooms up to 3 extra 50 items each room
 
An extra 20 Million will allow one room to be 2xRegen
Added Extra's such as Fountain's or Specific room descriptions

#
LINK

&2Link&n

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will not be
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.
#
MAP

&2Map&n

&3Usage:&n &4read map&n

A map of Haven is loaded with your character when you enter the game
for the first time. It shows all places of interest in the town and 
all exits from Haven. An Atlas of Primal is also available from the 
General Store for the price of 12 coins.

#
MISC

Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The
syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"  For example:

> tell rasmusse Hi there, how are you?
No-one by that name here.

> ^rasmusse^rasmussen
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'

> ^you^you doing^
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'

#
MONEY COINS

&2Money & Coin&n

Money is a necessary part of PrimalMud.  You need money to buy food and
drink, to buy practice sessions at the guild, to buy weapons, armor and
equipment, and so on.  The best way to make money is to kill monsters.
Most monsters will be carrying some money, and this can be picked up off
their corpse after you kill them.  If you practice
stealing at the guild, you can also steal coins off them.

Example (after killing monster):

  > examine corpse
  > get coin corpse
  > steal gold <mob>

See Also: EXAMINE GET STEAL
#
MORTAL KOMBAT MORTALKOMBAT

&2Mortal Kombat&n

&3Usage:&n &4mortalk&n

RULES

&2Rules&n

We want Primal Mud to be a fun and enjoyable place to be but this means
you need to abide by the few rules that we do set. Failure to read
POLICY and follow these rules can result in demotion, deletion and finally
banning of your site. We do not like to have to resort to these measure
so please read POLICY and follow the few guidelines we have set out.

Thank you The Gods at Primal.
#
SHOP SHOPS STORE

&2Shops & Stores&n

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the 
perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific 
type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even 
if it is of high quality!
To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

      might like to see here, they may get put in.
#
STAT STATS

&2Stats&n

STATS can be improved by TRAIN to improve your NATURAL base stats. This 
can be done at the Master Trainer who is located at the Paladin Temple in the
City of Haven.

As you progress through the levels you are given a bonus stat "point" per level
this will accumulate to help you train your stats up.

See Also: PRACTICE TRAIN 
#
STRING

&2String&n

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters. The
format is:

string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.
Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):
Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at. For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@@'.

Mobiles and objects currently can not be strung.
#
TAG

&2Tag&n

Tag is an area where you get to chase and tag all the other players in 
the zone.

There are certain rules you need to follow to play tag. These can be read
at the entrance of the tag arena on the tag board.

Two or more players are needed to play tag and to commence the game you need
to be teleported into the zone by a God. 

#
"TRAIN"

&2Train&n

&3Usage:&n &4list
       train <stat>
       train [amount] <hit | mana | move>&n

Train is used to improve your natural base stats. This can be done at the 
Master Trainer who is located at the Paladin Temple in the City of Haven.

The amount of stat points required to train 1 stat up can be found by using
the list option at the Master Trainer. The list will give you all information
required.  How much to train 1 Stat up by how many stat points you require.

At some point in your adventure you might find you need to learn spells and
skills that require a higher base stat than you started with.

You may also train your hit points and mana at the Training Master. The cost
of training Hit points, Mana and movement once cost gold and lots of it, now
training these 3 things cost experience.  So when you want to train them you
must have some experience "free" before you can. That means you can't level
then try to train as your experience is at it's highest. You would have to reduce
your experience down by fighting mobs then you could train. Just remember try
not to level if you want to train your hit or mana as then you have to start
all over again.

You can also train hit, mana and move in multiples in one statement see
Example:

  >train wis
  >train 20 hit
  >train hit

As a newbie you may experience mobs that are slightly tougher than yourself and can bring death to your door! When you do die in the game as a newbie you will find yourself sent back to the Riverside Tavern where you are resting, you will also have a "ghost" flag next to  your name in the who list.  Whilst being a ghost you will not be able to attack anything until you are fully restored to max hitpoints.  Once this has been done the "ghost" flag will automatically remove from your name and you will be able to continue fighting.

AC

&2AC&n

"AC" is your &2armor class&n.  It is a number from -10 to 10, roughly
defined as follows:

  10 Naked person
   0 Very Heavily armored (Plate mail, and "two shields") 
 -10 Armored battle tank

The score command displays your &2armor class&n as a number such as &378/10&n;
this means 78 on a scale from -100 to 100 (i.e., 7.8 on the scale from
-10 to 10.)

ALIGNMENT

&2ALIGNMENT&n

Your alignment is a measure of how good or evil you are.  This is a
number between &r-1000&n and &c1000&n, the greater the number, the more Good you
are.  If you drop below -350, you will be &rEvil&n, and will have a &rRed Aura&n
to those with Detect Alignment.  If you rise above 350, you will be
&cGood&n, and will have a &cBlue aura&n.

Some items require you to be either &cGood&n, &rEvil&n, or &WNeutral&n, before you
can use them.
#
ANGEL

&2ANGEL&n

&cAngels&n are players who should be held in high respect by all players.

They are here to help newbies, hold quests and help with the general
running of Primal Mud. 

*To become an &cAngel&n you need to reach the level of champion then you have
to contribute more than simply playing time. If you are interested in
becoming an &cAngel&n talk to one of the &YGod's&n about this.

BOARDS

&2Boards&n

Bulletin boards are the forum of interplayer communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type &4"LOOK BOARD"&n to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
&4"WRITE <subject>"&n to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a &4'@@ or /s'&n as the first character on a new line.  Type &4"READ <number>"&n 
to read a post.  Type &4"REMOVE <number>"&n to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > look at board
  > write Am I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@@ or/s']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6
#
CASINO

&2Casino&n

The Primal Casino is located adjacent to the Tavern.
It was implemented by the benevolent but oft misunderstood
God &1Talisman&n.
It's only purpose is to releive players of their hard earned
coin. Good luck.

NOTE: Talisman is also famous for his Tali_procs.

#
CHANGE

&2Change&n

This command will force your character to change into the werewolf or
vampire if infected by either of them.  The change command can only be
used at night so one would have to use the TIME command to keep track
of when night is.  Also the MOON command would have to be monitored as you 
can not change on a moonless night.

#
CHANNELS

&2Channels&n

Primal Mud has a wide range of channels you can talk on
Some of these channels are visible by all players, some are more private.
This is a rough list and guide to how you can communicate on Primal


SAY, ASK, GSAY,WHISPER  SHOUT, HOLLER, GOSSIP  <----- Available to all.
NEWBIE                                         <----- Available to all for newbie help

#
CHAMPION

&2Champion&n

Champion is the final level you can reach at primal by fighting mobs.
At reaching champion you may still kill mobs and players as well as 
obtaining a few extra advantages.
To advance to an Angel you need to contribute more than just playing time.
The Gods make a final decision on whether you are worthy to become
an angel so you need to show true Champion qualities first.
#
CLASSES

&2Classes&n

The current registered classes within Primal MUD are as follows:

Cleric / Magician / Thief / Warrior (base classes)
Druid / Priest / Nightblade / Battlemage / Spellsword / Paladin (first remort classes)
Master (ultimate class)
#
CREDITS

&2Credits&n

This will show you the original creators of the base we use.
#
EXPERIENCE XP

&2Experience&n

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points. When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

flags are always in parentheses, not brackets or braces.

GUILD

HOUSES

&2Houses&n

A house entails two things: access control and crash protection. 
Only you and your guests will be allowed to enter the house.  
Your house will be crash-saved every five minutes.  You can force 
your house to save by typing 'save' while standing in your house.
In the event of a crash, the objects in your house as of the last crash-save
will be loaded back into your house when the MUD reboots.  Also, if you own
a house, and quit from the game while standing in your house, you will be
loaded into your house next time you enter the game.

Guests of your house can be defined using the HOUSE command.  See HOUSE for
more information.

Houses are an alternative to renting.  You can simply enter your house,
drop your items, and type 'quit', and everything in your house
will be saved for you to retrieve on your return.
There is currently a 50 object limit which can be stored in your house.
Of course, players must expect to pay a much higher premium for
the convenience of houses;

contact Phoenix or Sandii mudmail for the purchace of a house.

HOUSE OPTIONS AND PRICE LIST
 
40 Million up front and a minimum level of 30 - one room 50 items

Extra 40 Million for additional rooms up to 3 extra 50 items each room
 
An extra 20 Million will allow one room to be 2xRegen

#
LINK

&2Link&n

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will not be
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.
#
MAP

&2Map&n

&3Usage:&n &4read map&n

A map of Haven is loaded with your character when you enter the game
for the first time. It shows all places of interest in the town and 
all exits from Haven. An Atlas of Primal is also available from the 
General Store for the price of 12 coins.

#
MISC

Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The
syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"  For example:

> tell rasmusse Hi there, how are you?
No-one by that name here.

> ^rasmusse^rasmussen
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'

> ^you^you doing^
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'

#
MONEY COINS

&2Money & Coin&n

Money is a necessary part of PrimalMud.  You need money to buy food and
drink, to buy practice sessions at the guild, to buy weapons, armor and
equipment, and so on.  The best way to make money is to kill monsters.
Most monsters will be carrying some money, and this can be picked up off
their corpse after you kill them.  If you practice
stealing at the guild, you can also steal coins off them.

Example (after killing monster):

  > examine corpse
  > get coin corpse
  > steal gold <mob>

#
MORTAL KOMBAT MORTALKOMBAT

&2Mortal Kombat&n

RULES

&2Rules&n

We want Primal Mud to be a fun and enjoyable place to be but this means
you need to abide by the few rules that we do set. Failure to read
POLICY and follow these rules can result in demotion, deletion and finally
banning of your site. We do not like to have to resort to these measure
so please read POLICY and follow the few guidelines we have set out.

Thank you The Gods at Primal.
#
SHOP SHOPS STORE

&2Shops & Stores&n

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the 
perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific 
type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even 
if it is of high quality!
To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

STAT STATS

&2Stats&n

STATS can be improved by TRAIN to improve your NATURAL base stats. This 
can be done at the Master Trainer who is located at the Paladin Temple in the
City of Haven.

As you progress through the levels you are given a bonus stat "point" per level
this will accumulate to help you train your stats up.

See Also: PRACTICE TRAIN 
#
STRING

&2String&n

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters. The
format is:

string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.
Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):
Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at. For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@@'.

Mobiles and objects currently can not be strung.
#
TAG

&2Tag&n

Tag is an area where you get to chase and tag all the other players in 
the zone.

There are certain rules you need to follow to play tag. These can be read
at the entrance of the tag arena on the tag board.

Two or more players are needed to play tag and to commence the game you need
to be teleported into the zone by a God. 

#
"TRAIN"

&2Train&n

&3Usage:&n &4list
       train <stat>
       train [amount] <hit | mana | move>&n

Train is used to improve your natural base stats. This can be done at the 
Master Trainer who is located at the Paladin Temple in the City of Haven.

The amount of stat points required to train 1 stat up can be found by using
the list option at the Master Trainer. The list will give you all information
required.  How much to train 1 Stat up by how many stat points you require.

At some point in your adventure you might find you need to learn spells and
skills that require a higher base stat than you started with.

You may also train your hit points and mana at the Training Master. The cost
of training Hit points, Mana and movement once cost gold and lots of it, now
training these 3 things cost experience.  So when you want to train them you
must have some experience "free" before you can. That means you can't level
then try to train as your experience is at it's highest. You would have to reduce
your experience down by fighting mobs then you could train. Just remember try
not to level if you want to train your hit or mana as then you have to start
all over again.

You can also train hit, mana and move in multiples in one statement see
Example:

  >train wis
  >train 20 hit
  >train hit

ALIGNMENT

&2ALIGNMENT&n

Your alignment is a measure of how good or evil you are.  This is a
number between &r-1000&n and &c1000&n, the greater the number, the more Good you
are.  If you drop below -350, you will be &rEvil&n, and will have a &rRed Aura&n
to those with Detect Alignment.  If you rise above 350, you will be
&cGood&n, and will have a &cBlue aura&n.

Some items require you to be either &cGood&n, &rEvil&n, or &WNeutral&n, before you
can use them.
#
ANGEL

&2ANGEL&n

&cAngels&n are players who should be held in high respect by all players.

They are here to help newbies, hold quests and help with the general
running of Primal Mud. 

*To become an &cAngel&n you need to reach the level of champion then you have
to contribute more than simply playing time. If you are interested in
becoming an &cAngel&n talk to one of the &YGod's&n about this.

BOARDS

&2Boards&n

Bulletin boards are the forum of interplayer communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type &4"LOOK BOARD"&n to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
&4"WRITE <subject>"&n to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a &4'@@ or /s'&n as the first character on a new line.  Type &4"READ <number>"&n 
to read a post.  Type &4"REMOVE <number>"&n to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > look at board
  > write Am I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@@ or/s']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6
#
CASINO

&2Casino&n

The Primal Casino is located adjacent to the Tavern.
It was implemented by the benevolent but oft misunderstood
God &1Talisman&n.
It's only purpose is to releive players of their hard earned
coin. Good luck.

NOTE: Talisman is also famous for his Tali_procs.

#
CHANGE

&2Change&n

This command will force your character to change into the werewolf or
vampire if infected by either of them.  The change command can only be
used at night so one would have to use the TIME command to keep track
of when night is.  Also the MOON command would have to be monitored as you 
can not change on a moonless night.

#
CHANNELS

&2Channels&n

Primal Mud has a wide range of channels you can talk on
Some of these channels are visible by all players, some are more private.
This is a rough list and guide to how you can communicate on Primal

CHAMPION

&2Champion&n

Champion is the final level you can reach at primal by fighting mobs.
At reaching champion you may still kill mobs and players as well as 
obtaining a few extra advantages.
To advance to an Angel you need to contribute more than just playing time.
The Gods make a final decision on whether you are worthy to become
an angel so you need to show true Champion qualities first.
#
EXPERIENCE XP

&2Experience&n

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points. When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

Only you and your guests will be allowed to enter the house.  
Your house will be crash-saved every five minutes.  You can force 
your house to save by typing 'save' while standing in your house.
In the event of a crash, the objects in your house as of the last crash-save
will be loaded back into your house when the MUD reboots.  Also, if you own
a house, and quit from the game while standing in your house, you will be
loaded into your house next time you enter the game.

Guests of your house can be defined using the HOUSE command.  See HOUSE for
more information.

Houses are an alternative to renting.  You can simply enter your house,
drop your items, and type 'quit', and everything in your house
will be saved for you to retrieve on your return.
There is currently a 50 object limit which can be stored in your house.
Of course, players must expect to pay a much higher premium for
the convenience of houses;

contact Phoenix or Sandii mudmail for the purchace of a house.

HOUSE OPTIONS AND PRICE LIST
 
40 Million up front and a minimum level of 30 - one room 50 items

Extra 40 Million for additional rooms up to 3 extra 50 items each room

LINK

&2Link&n

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will not be
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.
#
MAP

&2Map&n

&3Usage:&n &4read map&n

A map of Haven is loaded with your character when you enter the game

all exits from Haven. An Atlas of Primal is also available from the 
General Store for the price of 12 coins.

MISC

syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"  For example:

> tell rasmusse Hi there, how are you?
No-one by that name here.

> ^rasmusse^rasmussen
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'

> ^you^you doing^
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'

MONEY COINS

&2Money & Coin&n

Money is a necessary part of PrimalMud.  You need money to buy food and
drink, to buy practice sessions at the guild, to buy weapons, armor and
equipment, and so on.  The best way to make money is to kill monsters.
Most monsters will be carrying some money, and this can be picked up off
their corpse after you kill them.  If you practice
stealing at the guild, you can also steal coins off them.

Example (after killing monster):

  > examine corpse
  > get coin corpse
  > steal gold <mob>

shouted, or told someone).  This is useful to verify what you just said, but
can be annoying if you have a slow link.

RULES

&2Rules&n

We want Primal Mud to be a fun and enjoyable place to be but this means
you need to abide by the few rules that we do set. Failure to read

banning of your site. We do not like to have to resort to these measure
so please read POLICY and follow the few guidelines we have set out.

#
SHOP SHOPS STORE

&2Shops & Stores&n

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the 
perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific 
type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even 
if it is of high quality!
To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

this will accumulate to help you train your stats up.

See Also: PRACTICE TRAIN 
#
STRING

&2String&n

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters. The
format is:

string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.
Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):
Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at. For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@@'.

Mobiles and objects currently can not be strung.
#
TAG

&2Tag&n

Tag is an area where you get to chase and tag all the other players in 
the zone.

There are certain rules you need to follow to play tag. These can be read
at the entrance of the tag arena on the tag board.

Two or more players are needed to play tag and to commence the game you need
to be teleported into the zone by a God. 

#
"TRAIN"

&2Train&n

&3Usage:&n &4list
       train <stat>
       train [amount] <hit | mana | move>&n

Train is used to improve your natural base stats. This can be done at the 
Master Trainer who is located at the Paladin Temple in the City of Haven.

The amount of stat points required to train 1 stat up can be found by using
the list option at the Master Trainer. The list will give you all information
required.  How much to train 1 Stat up by how many stat points you require.

At some point in your adventure you might find you need to learn spells and
skills that require a higher base stat than you started with.

You may also train your hit points and mana at the Training Master. The cost
of training Hit points, Mana and movement once cost gold and lots of it, now
training these 3 things cost experience.  So when you want to train them you
must have some experience "free" before you can. That means you can't level
then try to train as your experience is at it's highest. You would have to reduce
your experience down by fighting mobs then you could train. Just remember try
not to level if you want to train your hit or mana as then you have to start
all over again.

You can also train hit, mana and move in multiples in one statement see
Example:

  >train wis
  >train 20 hit
  >train hit

Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure.

Specifically, the game will save your equipment while you are logged out.
There is a daily cost for renting, based on your equipment.  Each item has
a per diem charge.  The per diem charge is calculated to the nearest second,
however -- if you rent at the rate of 2400 coins per day, and you come back
39 hours later, you will be charged 3900 coins.

A CRYOGENIC CENTER will store your items for a one-time charge of four
days rent.  There are currently no Cryogenic Chambers in PrimalMud.

Rent files are deleted if you run out of money to pay the per diem charges
or after 30 days.  Cryogenic-rent files are deleted after 60 days.

-10 to 10.)

&yALIGNMENT&n
Your alignment is a measure of how good or evil you are.  This is a
number between &r-1000&n and &c1000&n, the greater the number, the more Good you
are.  If you drop below -350, you will be &rEvil&n, and will have a &rRed Aura&n
to those with Detect Alignment.  If you rise above 350, you will be

&yANGEL&n
Angels are players who should be held in high respect by all players.

They are here to help newbies, hold quests and help with the general
running of Primal Mud.

BOARDS

Bulletin boards are the forum of interplayer communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"WRITE <subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a '@@' as the first character on a line.  Type "READ <number>" to read a
post.  Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

> look at board

#
CHANGE

This command will force your character to change into the werewolf or
vampire if infected by either of them.  The change command can only be
used at night so one would have to use the TIME command to keep track

CHANNELS

Primal Mud has a wide range of channels you can talk on
Some of these channels are visible by all players, some are more private.
This is a rough list and guide to how you can communicate on Primal


SAY, ASK, GSAY,WHISPER  SHOUT, HOLLER, GOSSIP  <----- Available to all.
NEWBIE                                         <----- Available to all for newbie help
CTALK                                          <----- Visible to other clan members
IMMNET                                         <----- Eternals and above only

#
CHAMPION

Champion is the final level you can reach at primal by fighting mobs.
At reaching champion you may still kill mobs and players as well as 
obtaining a few extra advantages.

To advance to an Angel you need to contribute more than just playing time.
Preferably in the way of zones or code. If you are interested mud mail
Ruprect or Cassandra and they will send you out the documentation
by email about what is required.

The Gods make a final decision on whether you are worthy to become
an angel so you need to show true Champion qualaties first.

#
CLASS CLASSES

Classes are not actually used in PrimalMUD.  Instead, your race
determines your general attributes (Strength, Dexterity, etc.), and you
are then free to develop your character however you see fit.  This means
that all skills/spells are available to everyone, and you are free to
practice in any guild hall.
#
CLERIC

Classes are not actually used in PrimalMUD.  Instead, your general
characteristics are determined by your race, and you guide your
characters development from there.  The following is provided as a guide
if you wish to style yourself as a Cleric.

Clerics are characters who worship a god.  They dedicate their lives to
the furthering of that god's cause, and are in return granted certain
powers.  These powers take the form of spells, mainly non-violent such
as cure light wounds and heal, although higher-level Clerics will gain
more offensive spells (eg. Call Lightning).  Clerics as a class do not
carry piercing or slashing weapons, prefering instead the option of
bludgeoning their foe into submission.  A cleric improves their skills
(spells) by "prac"ticing at their temple.

DONATE

This command takes an object that you no longer want and deposits it in the
donation room of Haven to assist newbies in getting started.  There is
a 75% chance objects donated will wind up in a donation room in Haven,
and a 25% chance the item will be junked.

donate <object>

#
EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points. When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

flags are always in parentheses, not brackets or braces.

GUILD

The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles and
perils of a cruel world.
At present, there is no limit on which Guildhouse you may use to further
your skills, as characters  have no fixed guild.  You are responsible for 
shaping your character as you see fit.

HOUSES

Houses have been implemented as of CircleMUD 3.0.  A house entails two things:
access control and crash protection.  Only you and your guests will be allowed
to enter the house.  Your house will be crash-saved every five minutes.  You
can force your house to save by typing 'save' while standing in your house.
In the event of a crash, the objects in your house as of the last crash-save
will be loaded back into your house when the MUD reboots.  Also, if you own
a house, and quit from the game while standing in your house, you will be
loaded into your house next time you enter the game.

Guests of your house can be defined using the HOUSE command.  See HOUSE for
more information.

Houses are an alternative to renting.  You can simply enter your house,
drop your items, and type 'quitreally', and everything in your house
will be saved for you to retrieve on your return.
There is currently a 50 object limit which can be stored in your house.
Of course, players must expect to pay a much higher premium for
the convenience of houses;

contact Sandii or Kodiak by mudmail for the purchace  of a house.

HOUSE OPTIONS AND PRICE LIST
 
40 Million up front and a minimum level of 30 -one room 50 items

Extra 40 Million for additional rooms up to 5 extra 50 items each room
 
An extra 20 Million will allow one room to be 2xRegen
Added Extra's such as Fountain's Specific room descriptions
To be done at God's discretion or at a negotable price.

To move your house it will cost 40 million per-room.

NOTE: Only one house per character with the maximum of 5 rooms

INN INNS CRYOGENIC CRYO RECEPTION

Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure.

Specifically, the game will save your equipment while you are logged out.
There is a daily cost for renting, based on your equipment.  Each item has
a per diem charge.  The per diem charge is calculated to the nearest second,
however -- if you rent at the rate of 2400 coins per day, and you come back
39 hours later, you will be charged 3900 coins.

A CRYOGENIC CENTER will store your items for a one-time charge of four
days rent.  There are currently no Cryogenic Chambers in PrimalMud.

Rent files are deleted if you run out of money to pay the per diem charges
or after 30 days.  Cryogenic-rent files are deleted after 60 days.

#
LIGHT LANTERN TORCH

Type 'hold lantern' to light and hold your lantern.  Lanterns can be
purchased at the General Store.
#
LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will not be
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.
#
LIST

If you'd like to see what items a shop has for sale, take a look at the
list.  The list contains all of the items currently for sale and in
what quantity.  The price for each item is also listed.  If you are
interested in a particular type of item, you can specify which items to
list.
 
Examples:
 
> list             (list all items for sale)
> list sword       (list all swords for sale)

No-one by that name here.

> ^rasmusse^rasmussen
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'

> ^you^you doing^
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'

MONEY COINS

Money is a necessary part of PrimalMud.  You need money to buy food and
drink, to buy practice sessions at the guild, to buy weapons, armor and
equipment, and so on.  The best way to make money is to kill monsters.
Most monsters will be carrying some money, and this can be picked up off
their corpse after you kill them (get coins corpse).  If you practice
stealing at the guild, you can also steal coins off them.

Example (after killing monster):

> examine corpse

and type 'rent'; or type 'quitreally' to drop all your equipment where you
stand and quit; or purchase a house, and quit there.

store all your belongings.  You can then pick everything up when you
start again.

#
REPEAT

Use REPEAT to control whether or not the mud echoes your communication 
commands to you (i.e. the MUD will tell you what you just said, group-said,
shouted, or told someone).  This is useful to verify what you just said, but
can be annoying if you have a slow link.

RULES

We want Primal Mud to be a fun and enjoyable place to be but this means
you need to abide by the few rules that we do set. Failure to read
POLICY and follow these rules can result in demotion, deletion and finally
banning of your site. We do not like to have to resort to these measure
so please read POLICY and follow the few guidelines we have set out.

Thank you The Gods at Primal.

SHOP SHOPS STORE

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the 
perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of
high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

a powerful multi-class character.

STRING

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters. The
format is:

string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.
Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):
Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at. For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@@'.

Mobiles and objects currently can not be strung.
#
TAG

Tag is an area where you get to chase and tag all the other players in 
the zone.

There are certain rules you need to follow to play tag. These can be read
at the entrance of the tag arena on the tag board.

Two or more players are needed to play tag and to commence the game you need
to be teleported into the zone by a God. 

#
THIEF

Classes do not exist as such in PrimalMUD.  Instead, your race
determines you general characteristics, and you are free to guide your
character as you wish.  The following, therefore, is intended as a guide
if you wish to use the thief as a model.

Thieves are characters who have decided to rely more on their natural
wits than on study or faith.  Although not always evil or bad, they do
not tend to have the same sort of respect for authority that other
characters may have.  Their primary skills are their ability to sneak
around, hide from others, and generally be devious.  Their Guildhall is
suitably hidden, but when located they can "prac"tice their skills
there.  A thief is a very handy character to have on your side, but a
potential nightmare as an opponent...

#
"TRAIN"

TRAIN is used to improve your NATURAL base stats. This can be done at the 
Master Trainer who is located at the Paladin Temple in the City of Haven.

The price for buying a stat varies depending on how high the stat is.
To get a price type TRAIN on it's own at the Master Trainer.

At some point in your adventure you might find you need to learn spells and
skills that require a higher base stat than you started with.

You may also train your hit points and mana at the Training Master.
However after level 30 hit points will cost you 1 practice point as well.

This is where the Master Trainer comes in. So save your money if you want
a powerful multi-class character.

WARRIOR FIGHTER

Classes are not actually used in PrimalMUD.  Instead, your race
determines your general traits, and you are free to develop your
character as you wish.  The following is provided as a guide for those
who wish to style themselves Fighters.

The Warrior is physically the most impressive of the character types.
They are dedicated to the art of battle, and spend most of their lives
perfecting and honing their fighting skills.  They spurn magic,
preferring the comfort of cold steel to the vagaries of forces beyond
their understanding, or the whims of gods.  Likewise, they usually
prefer a straight-up fight to the sneaking and backstabbing methods of
the Thief.
The Warrior 'prac'tices their skills at their guild, under the tutelage
of a past master of swordplay.

RACE
  
The race system used in PrimalMUD allows for a wider range of character
statistics than that of the 4 'class' system used earlier. The races that
a character can be are:
 
       RACE       STR CON DEX INT WIS CHA
[ 1]  Ogre         3   3  -2  -2  -3  -3
[ 2]  Deva        -3  -3   1   3   3   1
[ 3]  Haruchai     1   1   3  -1  -1   0
[ 4]  Elf         -1  -2   3   2   1   3
[ 5]  Changling   -1  -3   1   3   1   1
[ 6]  Human        0   0   0   0   0   0
[ 7]  Orc          3   3   0  -3  -2  -2
[ 8]  Kobold       3   1  -2  -3  -1  -3
[ 9]  Dwarf        4   3  -2  -2  -2  -3

[11]  Kenda       -1   0   3   0  -1   2
[12]  Pixie        0  -1   3   0  -1   2

Type 'help <race>' for help on any specific race, ie:

> help changling

In addition to these race statistic modifiers, a player can select what order
their statistics are assigned dice rolls. The primary statistics are based on 
3d6 rolls which approximate a  standard bell curve, representing the 
ditribution within a population.

METHOD:
  1. The player chooses two stats and take best 3 of 8d6, re-rolling 1's
  2. The player choooses two remaining stats and take best of 4d6, re-roll 1's
  3. Roll 3d6 for remaining stats, re-roll 1's
  4. Higher rolls in [2] or [3] take precedence over lower rolls in [1] or [2]
  
To make this selection, there are 4 presets for statistic order, plus an option
  to select them manually. These options are:

  CLASS                 ORDER
  Cleric        WIS,INT,STR,DEX,CON,CHA
  Thief         DEX,STR,CON,INT,WIS,CHA
  Magic User    INT,WIS,DEX,STR,CON,CHA
  Warrior       STR,DEX,CON,WIS,INT,CHA

AC

"AC" is your armor class.  It is a number from -10 to 10, roughly
defined as follows:


  AC  Roughly equivalent to
-----------------------------------------------------------
  10  Naked person
   0  Very Heavily armored (Plate mail, and "two shields") 
 -10  Armored battle tank

The score command displays your armor class as a number such as 78/10;
this means 78 on a scale from -100 to 100 (i.e., 7.8 on the scale from
-10 to 10.)

BOARDS

Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"WRITE <subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a '@@' as the first character on a line.  Type "READ <number>" to read a
post.  Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > look at board
  > write Am I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@@']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6

#
CLERIC

Clerics have an ancient belief in not carrying sharp weapons.  Hence, they can
only wield bludgeoning weapons.  This class gives you the wisdom of peace,
blessing and healing, though it is possible to learn more violent spells.

You can improve your spells by using the practice command.

See 'help spells' for a list of spells available.

#
EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points.  When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points.  If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

#
FLAGS

Players sometimes have FLAGS after their names in the WHO list.  These
flags are always in parentheses, not brackets or braces.

  FLAG        MEANING
  ----------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  (KILLER)    Player is trying to kill other players.  That means you
              can try to kill him/her without being flagged.
  (THIEF)     Player is trying to steal from other players.  Fire away.
  (invis)     Player is invisible; you can see him/her because you are
              sensitive to the presence of invisible things.
  (writing)   Player is writing on the board; do not disturb.
  (mailing)   Player is writing mail; do not disturb.
  (deaf)      Player has chosen not to hear shouts.
  (notell)    Player has chosen not to accept tells.
  (quest)     Player is participating in a quest currently being run by
              the Gods.

GUILD

The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles and
perils of a cruel world.  Each guild is heavily guarded, so that only members
may enter the building.  Guilds are also the places where people come to
learn and practice the skills of their trade.

#
HOUSES

Houses have been implemented as of CircleMUD 3.0.  A house entails two things:
access control and crash protection.  Only you and your guests will be allowed
to enter the house.  Your house will be crash-saved every five minutes.  You
can force your house to save by typing 'save' while standing in your house.
In the event of a crash, the objects in your house as of the last crash-save
will be loaded back into your house when the MUD reboots.  Also, if you own
a house, and quit from the game while standing in your house, you will be
loaded into your house next time you enter the game.

Guests of your house can be defined using the HOUSE command.  See HOUSE for
more information.

Houses are an alternative to renting.  You can simply enter your house and
quit; your objects will drop to the ground and be crash-saved for when you
return.  There is currently no limit to the number of objects which can be
stored in your house.  Of course, players must expect to pay a much higher
premium for the convenience of houses; contact your local Implementor for
a fee schedule.

INN INNS CRYOGENIC CRYO RECEPTION

Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure.

Specifically, the game will save your equipment while you are logged out.
There is a daily cost for renting, based on your equipment.  Each item has
a per diem charge.  The per diem charge is calculated to the nearest second,
however -- if you rent at the rate of 2400 coins per day, and you come back
39 hours later, you will be charged 3900 coins.

A CRYOGENIC CENTER will store your items for a one-time charge of four
days rent.

Rent files are deleted if you run out of money to pay the per diem charges
or after 30 days.  Cryogenic-rent files are deleted after 60 days.

#
LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.
#
"MAGIC USER" WIZARD MAGE

This is the class of powerful and violent magic, but the magic user do not
control the nature, and can therefore not bless and such.

You can improve your spells by using the practice command.

See 'help spells' for a list of spells available.

#
MANA

Mana is used when casting spells.  You must have a certain amount of mana
in order to cast any particular spell.  If you do not have enough mana to
cast the spell you must rest until you gain enough points to cast.

SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact.  Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise.  Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
of high quality!

To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

THIEF THIEVES

Thieves are known to have very special qualities, that no other class offers.
Their specialty tends to be in the darker, sneakier art.  Many of these
qualities can come in handy in many situations, such as picking locks.

You can improve you skills by using the practice command.

Skills available to thieves:

sneak, hide, steal, backstab, pick lock, track

See the help on each skill for more information.

WARRIOR FIGHTER

Warriors are known to have more strength than the average player.  This makes
them better at hand-to-hand-combat, as they possess skills of violence and
fighting unequaled by the members of any other class.  However, they lack the
ability to use magic of any sort.

You can improve your skills by using the practice command.

Skills available to warriors:

kick, rescue, track, bash

CIRCLE CIRCLEMUD CREDITS

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink and George Greer, for submitting a veritable mountain of
     excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2, and Jack Patton and Steffen Haeuser for the
     Amiga port.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.
  -- Jules (hamotek sheli) for being the greatest.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!
