                               &y---------------&n
&yWELCOME to PrimalMUD&n
&y--------------------&n
You are about to embark on a voyage of danger and adventure.
Before you lies the world of fearsome monsters, magical treasures, challenging 
quests, and mind-bending puzzles. Prepare yourself, for the realm you find 
yourself in is a dangerous place fraught with a multitude of creatures, both 
exotic and mundane, who are determined to make your stay here a short one.

To aid you in your quest to achieve power and wealth in the realm, I have 
provided you with a few general tips and instructions in order to make your 
stay here a less painful one.


&yMANEUVERING AND MOVING&n
&y----------------------&n
Each section of the realms consists of a room or location. In order to move 
from place to place, you need to specify the direction in which you wish to 
go : &cnorth&n, &csouth&n, &ceast&n, &cwest&n, &cup&n and &cdown&n. You may abbreviate these and any
other commands ('&cn&n' always means '&cnorth&n' for example)

In order for you to know if there are any exits when you are in a room, type 
exit. You can also use the autoexit command by typing '&cautoexit&n' , exit will 
then be shown on screen each time you enter a room. To disable autoexit, 
simply type '&cautoexit&n' again. In certain places, there are doors and you need 
to open them in order to cross to the next room. Certain doors might be LOCKED. 
In this case either you find the key to unlock it or if you have the &cskill&n 
'&cpick lock&n', you can pick the locked door. Others include trapdoors, secret 
wall, secret floor etc.


&yITEM && EQUIPMENT&n
&y----------------&n
You start off with nothing on hand...ie naked. You need to equip yourself 
with the proper outfit and items so that you are more or less protected. There
are some basic commands which you will need to use frequently, namely ::

&cWEAR REMOVE WIELD HOLD EQUIPMEMT INVENTORY DROP GET LOOK EXAMINE&n

&yWEAR&n::You will need to wear some clothing and armor. 
        Syntax -- &cwear&n boots / &cwear&n all / &cwear&n all.bracelets

&yREMOVE&n::When you want to take off something from your body.
        Syntax -- &crem&n boots / &crem&n all / &crem&n all.bracelets

&yWIELD&n::For using of weapons.
        Syntax -- &cwi&n sword / &cwi&n dagger / &cwi&n thunderbolt

&yHOLD&n::Certain items can be hold.
        Syntax -- &chold&n wand / &chold&n staff / &chold&n stone

&yEQUIPMENT&n::This is use to check what you are presently wearing.
        Syntax -- &ceq&n 

&yINVENTORY&n::This will show a list of items that is in your possession.
        Syntax -- &ci&n / &cinv&n

&yDROP&n::When there is a need to get rid of unwanted things. Note that the item
      must be in your inventory and not on your body
        Syntax -- &cdrop&n bread / &cdrop&n all.bread

&yGET&n::When you want to pick up something which is on the ground.
        Syntax -- &cget&n all corpse / &cget&n cloak / &cg&n all.coins / &cg&n potion bag

&yLOOK&n::See the area, the surrounding but within the room you are in.
        Syntax -- &cl&n / &cl&n Murf / &cl&n guard / &cl&n board

&yEXAMINE&n::Check an item.
        Syntax -- &cexa&n corpse / &cexa&n bag / &cexa&n chest

Certain items, like scrolls, wands, potions, water containers, and food, all 
require special commands to be used. These commands are : recite, use, quaff,
drink, and eat. See help file on individual commands for more details.


&yFOOD && WATER&n
&y------------&n
You will get tired and need to rest. Similarly you will get hungry and thirsty
So you must know where to get food and water. Food can be purchased from most
Grocers or General Store. Water can be found in town at the fountain near
Council Square. You will need a water skin to fill the water from the fountain
When inside the store, there is usually a sign for you to look at. Read the 
sign for instruction. typing '&clist&n' will give you a list of items selling. To
buy an item, type '&cbuy&n meat'. Money will automatically be deducted from you.


&yDONATION ROOM&n
&y-------------&n
Donation room is located at the south-eastern end of Haven. This is the place
where you can get most of your basic equipment, and if you are lucky, you may 
be able to get some good items donated by some kind players.


&yCOMBAT && FIGHTING&n
&y-----------------&n
There are certain commands for combat usage. 

&cKILL CON ASSIST FLEE HIT WIMPY&n
                                                                          
&yKILL&n   applies to killing a monster. Note that this command is similar to &cHIT&n

&yCON&n    is the abbreviation of consider. When type '&ccon&n guard' , it will 
       roughly tells you how capable you are in fighting against it

&yASSIST&n works only for members of the group. During a fight, members of the
       group can assist their TANKER by typing '&cassist&n &b<&nname of tanker&n>'
       &yTANKER&n refers to the person who hits the monster first.

&yFLEE&n   when you are low in hp and know that you can't win the fight.

&yWIMPY&n  applies to the minimum hp which will make you flee. Meaning that if you
       set &cwimpy&n 30, once your hp drops below 30 you will automatically flee.


&yDYING && CORPSE&n
&y--------------&n
There has been an &cautocorpse&n system implemented. Please see the help 
for information regarding how this works and how much it costs! There is
also a &cghost&n facility for players who are considered "newbies".
If you die in a fight, you will be reincarnated in your home city. All your 
eqiupment and gold will be left behind with your corpse. You need to go back 
to the place which you died in order to get back all your stuff. Experience 
points will also be lost when you die. Ask for help if you are not capable
enough to get back to your corpse.

NOTE: YOUR CORPSE WILL &RDECOMPOSE IN 20 MINS&n.


&yRENT&n
&y----&n
Currently you do not have to rent. To exit the game type '&cquitr&n'. Your
equipment will be handed to you upon entering a world next time you enter.


&yHELP&n
&y----&n
Typing &chelp&n will show you a list of commands. Use '&chelp&n &b<&ntopic&b>&n' to find
out more about the particular topic.


&yOTHER INFORMATION&n
&y-----------------&n
PrimalMUD uses ANSI colors, to view these and your other peronal settings type
'&ctoggle&n'.


&yPOLICY && NEWS&n
&y-------------&n
These are two common thing most players ignore. Please read them once you have 
the chance ('&cpolicy&n', '&cnews&n;). There are certain rules you will need to
follow. Generally &cnews&n will be updated everytime something new is put on. 


&yOTHER ADVICE&n
&y------------&n
As much as possible, do not bother the immortals with questions concerning
subjects which can be found in the help file. If you find yourself in need of
help, attempt to contact a mortal for help, a higher level maybe, they should 
be able and more-than-willing to help you.


For further information refer to '&chelp&n' and '&ccommands&n'.

Classes, skills, and guilds:
d16 150
a165 39
When you enter the game the first time, you are asked to select a class; either
THIEF, WARRIOR, CLERIC, or MAGIC user. Characters belonging to each of these
classes have their own qualities, abilities, and handicaps.
   It is not unusual that people belonging to different classes, by joining
their efforts and combining their skills, find their chances of survival and
progress greatly improved. Indeed, a team consisting of members from all four
classes can be an extremely powerful unit; capable of opening doors without
keys, creating food supplies out of nothing, and destroying an enemy in
several different ways. It is not advisable for a new player to offend the
members of such a group!

In order to learn the tricks of your specific trade, you need to find your
GUILD, which may take a little exploring. However, you can usually find a 
guild in any reasonably populated city. Once you've found it, you need to
look up your guildmaster and PRACTICE.

Equipment:

It is never wise to travel without the proper equipment. You may purchase this
in the SHOPS found in any larger city, or you may be lucky and find some left
around, dropped by someone who doesn't need it anymore, for one reason or
another.

About Staying Fit - Eating and Drinking:

At one time or another, you'll see the message "You are hungry". This means
that it's time to find something edible before too long. People don't starve
to death in this world, so have no fear. However, when you are hungry, you do
not build up lost energy, so eventually you'll be unable to do anything but sit
around and feel sorry for yourself, until someone comes by. Then, you can only
hope that it's a benevolent person, rather than a greedy thief or a warrior
lusting for blood.

General hints:

 See help on the group command.
 See help on the consider command.
 See help on resting.
 See help on your class (magic user, cleric, warrior or thief).
