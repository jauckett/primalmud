Notes:
-====-
Colour codes for the personal colour system (see colours.txt) should be used
now where appropiate.

If you feel like contributing or know anyone that does, email tali, sandii and 
myself and I'm sure we'll find something for you to do.

Legend:
-=====-
(percentage complete)				(Majorly in charge of files)

99% means ready for testing.

Majorly in charge of files:
Meaning that the person is basically responsible for other code in listed 
file(s) which is not explicitly stated in this document.

ALL:
-==-
( 0%) Check/Define rules and policies for gods (immortal handbook)
( 0%) Check/Fix the existing policy

These need a good looking at, and could be rewritten.
I say we informally list all points (in a file somewhere) that we would like to
see in both the immortals handbook, and the policy. Once we are happy that
everything is in there, then we have a meeting to discuss it.
