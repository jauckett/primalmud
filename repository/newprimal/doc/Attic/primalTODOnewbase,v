@================================================================================
                                New Base TODO 
================================================================================
 
                                  PrimalMUD
 
                   Created by John Auckett and Brett Murphy,
                     Using a Game System by Steven Wark,
                Based on CircleMUD 3.0, created by Jeremy Elson.
 
================================================================================

This file is kept under the repository at:
newprimal/docs/primalTODOnewbase

If any changes are made and you do not have access to them, please email them
to myself (Dangermouse). Further please note that this is a text file, and
if any changes are made, they should be saved as text only.

Notes:
-====-
Colour codes for the personal colour system (see primalColours) should be used
now where appropiate.

If you feel like contributing or know anyone that does, email talisman, sandii 
and myself and I'm sure we'll find something for you to do.

These need a good looking at, and could be rewritten.
I say we informally list all points (in a file somewhere) that we would like to
see in both the immortals handbook, and the policy. Once we are happy that
everything is in there, then we have a meeting to discuss it.

********************************************************************************
New Ideas:

Explosives:
  Mortal - implement some kind of explosives.
  Immortal - blow up a zone

Rooms:
  Fire - make rooms able to catch fire - make it able to spread, and be put out
  Flooded - similar to fire ...

Immortal System:
  Aside from the immortal entertainment system, I was talking with Per, and he 
  said he thought that some sort of punnishment channel would be cool. It 
  basically lets everyone know what someone has been punished for. It'd need 
  some kind of humour - tali, you think you are a funny guy :p

  He also spoke about player discipline. It's a topic I'd like to speak about
  with others at some stage too. 

Skills:
  Victim cant cast spells/recite scrolls/quaff stuff (Boz)

Spells:
  Energise - transfer mana to target (Boz)
  
Group:
  Mana Pool - distance dependant on usage, add inform messages xxx casts yyy
  <zzz> mana used or something (Boz)

Wear Positions:
  Fingers, Face eq. (Boz)
