@                     Compiling CircleMUD Version 3.0
                under Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT
                           using Borland C++

		Written by Mundi King <kingmundi@@yahoo.com>

Here are some instructions on compiling circlemud using Borland C++ 5.01. 
These instructions will not work using Turbo C++, or the 4.0 versions of
Borland C++ as those two products were geared twoards DOS and Windows 3.xx. 

It will most likely work with versions 5.00 and 5.02 of Borland C++ compilers. 

Boot up your Windows 95 machine.

Unzip your CircleMUD package.

Goto a DOS prompt, and change to the circle \src directory. 

(Type) rename conf.h.win conf.h (Enter)

(Type) make -fmakefile.bcc (Enter)

  Something to note here is that this makefile 
  assumes that you have installed Borland C++ 5.01 
  to the C: drive.  If you have installed it to
  another drive you will have to open up
  Makefile.bcc in a text editor and find and
  replace all C:\ references to the drive letter
  it has been installed to.
	
(Type) move circle.exe ..\ (Enter)

(Type) cd .. (Enter)

(Type) circle (Enter)

The game should start loading the zones and database.  You will no longer be
able to type in this DOS box. 

Click on START and then on RUN.

(Type) telnet localhost 4000 (Enter)

  The first one to logon becomes the Implentor.
  Also remember that you are using Windows95's
  built-in telnet program which is very basic.

Pat yourself on the back.
