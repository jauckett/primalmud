@CASINO GAMBLE GAMBLING

Casinos are rooms where gambling is allowed on Primal MUD.

Many different games can be played at one time, the only 
limit being your supply of cash. At the moment there are
3 games available for your entertainment.

	- Horse Racing 
	- Blackjack
	- Slots

See: Race, Blackjack, Slots

RACING RACE HORSE

Horse races run approximately every minute on Primal.

To be part of a race you must go to a casino, and use
the "race" command to bet. The bet is done by putting
an amount after the command. Ie, "race 1000" will put
1000 coins on the next race. In order to influence 
the amount you win, you can bet on shorter or longer
chances. This represents a bet on a horse with a higher
or lesser chance of winning, respectively.

Eg:
	race 1000 	- Bet 1000 on next race (Regular)
	race 1000 short - Bet 1000 on a good horse
	race 1000 long	- Bet 1000 on an unlikely horse

Depending on your bet type, if you win you will be
reimbursed appropriately. If you leave the casino
with a bet on a horse, the casino will inform you of 
the result as soon as the race is completed.

BLACKJACK BJ

Blackjack is otherwise known as "21", and the casino
provides several tables at which the game may be
legally played with primal cash.

The rules:
The aim of the game is to get a score of 21 or less 
given 5 or fewer cards. The player plays against
the dealer, and has the advantage of going first.

Card Values:
-Face cards(Jack, Queen, King) are worth ten points.
-Number cards(2 -> 10) are valued at their own number.
-Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points. The default
  value is 11 points unless that would take the score
  above 21, in which case it is set to 1.

Winning:
Blackjack - 2 cards - an ace and a card worth 10 points.
High Score - Having a higher score than the dealer.
Player gets 5 cards and is still at 21 or less.
Dealer Bust - Dealer goes over 21.

Losing:
Player Bust - Player goes over 21
Dealer Blackjack.
Dealer gets 5 cards and is still 21 or less.
Leaving casino premises for longer than 15 seconds.

Drawing:
Push - If player and dealer have same score.

Splitting:
When given the initial 2 cards, if they are of equal value
(except ACEs), the player can opt to double up and play two
games. A prompt will come up indicating this option.
Once a game is split, you will be dealt a new card 
to the first game, and the second game will be ready
once the first is completed.

Playing:
bj 1000		- Starts a game, with a bet of 1000
bj hit		- Asks the dealer for another card
bj stay		- Tells the dealer you are done
bj split	- Indicates a desire to split the game
bj		- If playing, this will show a player
		  their hand.

*NOTE: "bj" may be used in lieu of the "blackjack" command*

SLOT SLOTS 

This game is quite simple, and just involves putting 
money into a machine, and hoping for the best as 
reels spin. The payouts can be staggeringly large
if the player is lucky enough.

Playing:
	slots 1000	- Puts 1000 coins in, and starts

Winning:
5 reels will show up, each with a value. If there is a 
winning combination, the player is informed, and their
money credited appropriately. Free spins can also be 
won if a Straight shows up (5 sequential cards).
