** Due to the length that this conversion is taking we have set some dates for completion.
You will see before the percentage a new range of numbers from 1-5 being a priority of workload.
The alpha completion date is to be around middle of December (actual date tba) and anything with a priority higher than 3 is required to be completed before the alpha date.  Anything with a priority of 4 or 5 is required to be online and completed before the beta stage is put into transition which is approxiamately around February next year but exact date tba!  If anyone has any problems with priorities or workload please email sandii and arrangements will be made to move or assist the workload.

Thanks!
Your ever gratefull Goddess
SANDII

********************************************************************************
Ideas: (on the back-burner)

P5 ( 0%) Scan descriptions for keywords in room and highlight (Room Description Info)

( 0%) Quest logging system - make it log the date, type, char's, winner, prizes into quest file.

( 0%) Immortal System
  - immortal entertainment system

( 0%) File Buffer Paging System
( 0%) Dynamic Global Vars which are saved to file (used filevar types)

( 0%) Rooms
       - Fire - make rooms able to catch fire - make it able to spread, and be put out
       - Flooded - similar to fire ...
       - Capability to have "Armageddon" 

( 0%) Explosives
       - Mortal - implement some kind of explosives.
       - Immortal - blow up a zone

( 0%) God affects
       - Mortal's will feel earth shake (earthquake) due to gods warring!
       - Peace command to be worked on 

( 0%) Grouping: Mana Pool - distance dependant on usage, add inform messages 
        xxx casts yyy <zzz> mana used or something (Boz)

( 0%) Spell/Skill Fortify room: 
	Once cast (or performed) on a room, mobs cannot enter room until the caster moves from the room.
	A Med-high level skill and a high level spell. Could extend it to stoping PC's, 
	but this will require the addition of a !FORTIFY zone flag.

	affected stats for spell: int, con, str, wis
	affected stats for skill: con, str, int

	Resistance level could be calculated via the stats given above.  (Idea submitted by Artus)

( 0%) Make mail saveable - 
	Ideas put forward on this option:
		Make Mud stable and mail won't vanish!
		Make Mud able to intergrate with gui based email client and be interactive!
		Make all mud addy's part of the hotmail interface.
		Teach all players that there is a thing called "Email" and is a far better system than the mudmail 		  facility
                Integrate mudmail with email - shouldn't be too difficult (DM)

( 0%) Recall point to be modified by player

( 0%) Look at retreat bug!

( 0%) Look at emote ability by all levels

( 0%) Look at all quick keys being level restricted ie ;/:-
