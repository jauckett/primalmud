        gems - trade for exp/quest points ...

********************************************************************************
Ideas: (on the back-burner)

  into a file

( 0%) Dynamic Global Vars which are saved to file (used filevar types)

( 0%) Rooms
       - Descriptions for night/day - special descriptions
       - Fire - make rooms able to catch fire - make it able to spread, and be put out
       - Flooded - similar to fire ...

( 0%) Explosives
       - Mortal - implement some kind of explosives.
       - Immortal - blow up a zone

- Spell/Skill fortify room (idea by Artus): Once cast (or performed) on a room,
  mobs cannot enter room until the caster moves from the room. A med-high
  level skill and a high level spell. Could extend it to stoping PCs, but this
  will require the addition of a !FORTIFY zone flag. 

  affected stats for spell: int, con, str, wis
  affected stats for skill: con, str, int

  Resistance level could be calculated via the stats given above.

- make mail saveable ...

These need a good looking at, and could be rewritten.
I say we informally list all points (in a file somewhere) that we would like to
see in both the immortals handbook, and the policy. Once we are happy that
everything is in there, then we have a meeting to discuss it.

Explosives:
  Mortal - implement some kind of explosives.
  Immortal - blow up a zone

Rooms:
  Fire - make rooms able to catch fire - make it able to spread, and be put out
  Flooded - similar to fire ...

Immortal System:
  Aside from the immortal entertainment system, I was talking with Per, and he 
  said he thought that some sort of punnishment channel would be cool. It 
  basically lets everyone know what someone has been punished for. It'd need 
  some kind of humour - tali, you think you are a funny guy :p

  He also spoke about player discipline. It's a topic I'd like to speak about
  with others at some stage too. 

Skills:
  Victim cant cast spells/recite scrolls/quaff stuff (Boz)

Spells:
  Energise - transfer mana to target (Boz)
  
Group:
  Mana Pool - distance dependant on usage, add inform messages xxx casts yyy
