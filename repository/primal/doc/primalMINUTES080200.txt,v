@Class/Remort System
================
The basic idea is that you have 2 remort levels. When creating a new character, you choose your 
initial class. For first remort you "join" your class with another initial class and branch to the listed available classes. For the second remort, you become a Master*.

Classes		Remort level 1		Remort Level 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Warrior		W-T	Nightblade	Master*
Thief		W-C	Paladin		
Cleric		W-M	BattleMage	
Mage		T-C	Priest		
		T-M	Spellsword
		C-M	Druid*		

* Name to be modified?

Guilds
--------
Back in use, have the base guilds around haven, and the others situated elsewhere around the mud.

Stats
-------
Stats will be rolled according to classes and races, but you will not get to choose the order. Re-roll on create character will be enabled on initial entry to the game.

Training - Characters will be able to train only class specific stats.

Points
---------
On remort, HPS, MANA, and MOVE are set back to (base start points) x (remort level).

The amount of HPS, MANA and MOVE gained per level shall be based on a multiplier which is dependent upon the characters class (ie. and higher for the remort classes).

Training - HPS/MANA/MOVE will be available for training at the expense of EXP (the EXP per HP based on the characters level). Also based on actual points, not affected.

Exp
----
The amount of exp required per level shall also be a multiplier times by the base exp set, the multiplier dependent upon the characters class (ie. and higher for remort classes).

Remort Specials
---------------------
The character shall be able to choose some remort specials (ie. permanent sanc/bless/or whatever). If the character decides to do this, then the exp multiplier shall be adjusted (upwards) to compensate for the advantage.

Equipment
--------------
Equipment shall be restricted as is - ie. a level 1 Remort 1/2 character will have lvl 1 eq restrictions.

Quest Systems
============
Re-write the quest eq from scratch (TSD??).

The addition of an online quest log, where chars are assigned quest eq (view/add/delete).

Automatic Quest Systems (Ideas needed):

Card System **
-----------------
Character buys cards with gold (more quest points available at a higher price, also level dependent), are required to complete what is on the card (which can be given in riddle questions).
- get eq			(touch eq card)
- kill mobs		(automatic mark)
- multiple choice answers?	(select answer)
Returns card to quest master and have answers evaluated. If correct, they receive the quest points. Limit the amount of correct quests that can be completed by a char to a level, or a level range (ie. 2 per level, 1 per 5 levels or whatever): to reduce the amount of QP's available and the help from other players.

Champ System
===========
Renaming of champs to immortals?

Fighting system to record (this doesn't just apply to champs, but a further incentive for champs).
#mortal kills 	(and by)
#immortal kills	(and by)
#mob kills	(and by)

Shopkeepers
==========
Prices based on CHA, skills such as negoiate/haggle.

Spell Ideas
========
higher sanc -> Ice Wall
rename "word of recall" to "recall"

Fixes/Additions
============
haste
werewolf/vamps back
HR/DR limit - increase

Zones
=====
Take out defaults (so all mostly original):
rome - move valley of gods elsewhere
rands tower
three of swords
weriths wayhouse

Move Toyheim to Future World
Link Fairtale Forrest where Toyheim was

Move (remove?) market way to go straight south from the city (through council chambers)

Think about how we want the worlds connected (ie. via portals, or mob specials, where/how).**
