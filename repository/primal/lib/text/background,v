PrimalMUD was developed roughly 5 years ago by the owners
John, Murf and Cassandra.  When they introduced it they wanted
three different worlds that people could adventure in.
They were and still are: Mediaval World, Future World and West World.
The idea was based on the movie West World.

When PrimalMUD went live it boomed and was very active with
lots of new players discovering it every day. 

The Gods ruled supreme and the players had to watch what they
said as Murf ruled with an iron fist and the infamous "Death Sword" 
put many a player to rest rather swiftly.  

John was notorious for just sitting there invisible,
watching what was going on. When he had had enough he would come visible,
goto you, maybe say some choice words, then kill you in one hit. If
you had pushed him too far your character would be deleted along with it.

Cassandra was just as swift to bring judgement down on a player that was
not behaving in accordance with the policies at the time.  Cassandra
developed some of the most famous zones within the game.  Her ability to 
grasp the concept of "balance" shows within her zones.


Many people have felt the wrath and power of John, Murf and Cassandra.
If you ever see these characters on you should treat them with much respect
and awe as they made Primal what it is today, have the ultimate power 
within the game and have the ability to make life for your character HELL.
