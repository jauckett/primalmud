                           &r6th October 1999&n


As you will see we are still working on trying to improve PrimalMUD. 
Any suggestions may be submitted via mudmail to either Dangermouse
or Sandii at anytime.


&yNEW ZONES&n:  The Odd House 
            Scorpion Swamp (online testing)
            The Island Forever (online testing)
            Primal Casino

&yUPDATES&n:    Some of the old documents have been updated of late so please
            take some time to read the following:
            Help (I am constantly updating this file when i find something
             missing from it)

&yNEW SPELLS&n: Divine Heal - Level 70
            Lightning Shield - Level 65
            Fire Shield - Level 75
            Fire Wall - Level 90
            Identify - 37

&yNEW COMMANDS&n:   &cAutosplit&n - autosplit coins between group members, must have
                autogold on first. 


We have lots of ideas that are to being looked into and developed so please keep 
an eye out on the news documentation as i will be posting bulletins when the 
changes are in place.

Thanks

Sandii
