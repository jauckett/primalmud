Farlenian~
Farlenian~
Farlenian the soldier stands and watches quietly.
~
   Farlenian is a dark-haired, blue-eyed man with an extremely
grave expression drawn upon his face.  He wears a bright blue
set of overalls, with some protective layers of leather overtop
and a white cloak to round it out.  His crossbow looks well-used
and cared for.  You think he knows how to use it.

Koofy gerbil~
Koofy~
A small gerbil is eating some peanuts on a table here.
~
   It's a small, well-groomed and well-cared for brown
gerbil.  Its sniffing around some peanuts quietly,
and then promptly shoves the lot of them in its mouth!

Alerka~
Alerka~
Alerka Bardbane is resting here.
~
   Alerka sneers at you rudely, and ignores you.  He looks
rather non-descript and plain, just an ordinary man taking
a break.
   His knives do not look ordinary at all, however.

Drogo~
Drogo the Dwarf is polishing his axe here.
~
   Drogo Bloodstain, dwarf at large.  He polishes his battle
axe with a fervor, more than once licking the blade to put
a shine on it.  He seems to be having fun...to each his own.

Desslok elf dark~
Desslok~
A dark elf stands against the wall, watching.
~
   You feel his eyes bore through you for a moment, and then whisk
away.  He stands motionless, quietly...awaiting a proper moment
perhaps?

Airden~
Airden the Wanderer~
Airden the Wanderer is taking a break from wandering here.
~
   Airden is a tall, skinny human, dressed in simple clothes.  He
smiles at you and nods hello.  The dust on his clothes tells
tales of many strange lands and stranger adventures, and for
a moment you consider asking him to tell you a story.

A young kid stands out of the way here.

drunk!  Hey!  Who gave the kid a drink?

Eshiay woman~
Eshiay~
A young woman sits here, a confused expression upon her face.
~
   Eshiay seems somewhat pretty, but very confused.  She moves
a little awkwardly, as if her body doesn't fit her very well.
She smiles at you uncertainly, and then ignores you.

Jordo~
Jordo~
Jordo the Engineer is just hanging out here.
~
  Jordo's eyes glint viciously as he looks across the
room.  From the way his hands tighten on his weapon,
you can tell that he isn't quite as at ease as he
would like you to believe.

waiter~
a waiter~
A waiter rushes by, intent on his business.
~
   He looks harried from the way he hastily takes orders and rushes
in the back to get food, and to the bar for drinks.  He doesn't even
spare you a glance as he passes by.

farmer~
a farmer~
A tired farmer relaxes here, for awhile.
~
   The dust and dirt of the land cover this man head to toe.  His
eyes look weary, his hands calloused, and those big workboots he's
wearing just can't be comfortable.  This man is one of the citizenry
elite; he feeds the people through his own hard work.  Maybe you
should buy him a beer.

Werith~
Werith~
Werith tends bar here, listening but not talking very much.
~
   From the size of those arms, this man must've once been a blacksmith.
You bet he can more than take on anyone who wants to knock over his
wayhouse for a little cash...this man is truly immense.  His movements
sure, his eyes keen...you don't think messing with him would be a good
idea.

   He nods, smiles, and asks you what you would like to drink.
As you decide, he mixes a Franjie Deluxe for the guy down the
ways a bit, his hands quickly and surely spinning the lemon over
the sides of the glass.

   With one hand he fries, with the other he flips the meat over,
and with the other hand he sprinkles some salt into the other hand
which is holding...hey!  Isn't that too many hands?

   This guy is good.
