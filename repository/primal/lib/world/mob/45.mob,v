Slizzarr~
Slizzarr the serpent lord stands here hissing menacingly.

You see a monstrus creature stand before you.  It has the head of a
giant cobra and the body of a human.  It radiates an air of death.
Its red cold eyes pierce through you causing you to shudder.

The Wind Duke is standing here summoning the winds to his bidding.

The Wind Duke looks mighty indeed.  In his outstretched hands you see small
whirlwinds dancing in a joyed frensy.  A glint in his eyes shows his awesom
powers!.

You see a strange monster indeed.  Its obviously the twisted creation of an

Wally is standing here trying to hide.

Wally is a rather geeky looking man.  He wears thick glasses.  And awful
