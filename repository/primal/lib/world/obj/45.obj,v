You see a pair of green gloves.  Shiny scales cover them completely.
Menacing claws protrude from its fingertips.  Looking inside the gloves
you spot small tentacles waiting to burry themself in your flesh.  The
gloves have a feel of great power.

                                   TAG Rules!
                                   ==========

The aim of tag is to tag other players before they tag you.  To do this you
will need to type in;

tag <player-name>   i.e.  tag drax

You are to enter the ARENA and find a place to start from.  You will be given
a minute or two to do this.  Once the person running the TAG game says go you
are to move around the zone looking for the other players and try to tag
them out before they tag you.

It is recommended that you move around as there will be a higher chance of 
finishing the game quicker.

The rules for the game are;

* Spells are not allowed.  <And u can't cast them anyway>
* You cannot use track or scan.
* Use of any skills like sneak/hide is prohibited.
* Mud client TRIGGERS ARE NOT ALLOWED!!!!!!!
* Player killing in Zone is prohibited!.
* As soon as you are teleported u are allowed to start the game. So good luck.

ENJOY THE GAME!   - Drax.
