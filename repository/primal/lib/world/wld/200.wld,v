Gate To Angel Grove~
You stand before a large gate. Well it's not really a gate, more like two posts.
To the west you see the mighty city of Angel Grove, renowned for it's great
architecture, and lately for some of the strange happenings that have taken place
there.

Angel Street~
You are at the beginning of Angel street. It leads a long way to the west.
There are many trees surrounding you, they are just starting to lose their
leaves and you think that this is the most beautiful scene you have ever seen.

Intersection of Angel and High~
This is the intersection of Angel St and Hight St. It's not very busy.The air
is very clean and unpolluted. Angel street leads further west, while High leads
to the north, to Angel Grove High School where from what you hear the there has
been some unexplained activity,

High Street~
This is a short yet rather wide street, allowing two lanes of traffic to pass
each way. Like everything else you have seen in Angel Grove this road has many
bushes, shrubs and trees on each side. The road leads further north to Angel
Grove High and south to Angel Road.

At School Entrance~
You stand at the school entrance recalling the dreadful twelve years you spent in
a place similar to this. All you can think about are plans on how to completely
destroy this place, and spare the many prisoners inside from an education. To
the north is the foyer of the school and to the south is high street, leading to
Angel St.

School Foyer~
You stand in a large well lit room. When you look up you can hardly see the
ceiling. Normally this place would be buzzing with action, teachers students bags
and books, but today it's abandoned the only people here are serving a punishment
and the only noise comes from the cleaners. To the north is the main corridor and
to to the south is the entrance to the school

Corridor~
A typical corridor. On the walls are some stupid posters encouraging you to read
and involve yourself in "fun" school activities. There are many pieces of junk on
the floor, perhaps some of it is worth something? One thing is certain: the
cleaners have not done a very good job.

Corridor~
You walk further along the corridor noticing that this place is not as deserted
as you initially thought. To the north is a classroom with some people in it.
There is more corridor to the west and east

Corridor~
This section of the corridor looks pretty much like all the other ones, there is
a classroom to the south, and it seems pretty empty, but you can't be too sure.
The corridor stretches further west, and east. In the distance west you see what
looks like the school cafeteria.

Corridor Before Cafeteria.~
You stand before the entrance to the school cafeteria. It seems to be deserted 
right now, but the vending machines might still work. It smells of a mixture of
ammonia, bleach dishwasher detergent and rotten food. This might be where the
cool kids always hang out. To the west is the cafeteria itself, and to the
east is a long corridor

Cafeteria~
This is a large hall, with many tables. All the chairs are stacked up neatly in
the corner. The floor is slightly wet and slippery, the cleaners were probably
here not so long ago. To the east is the corridor, and to the north are two
swinging doors, leading ummmm, somewhere. You'd better LOOK there before you go 
in!

Kitchen~
As you walk in you see a large kitchen. There are many different metallic things
here, mostly pots and pans, you wonder if any of them will come in handy in your
travels. To the south is the cafeteria, and to the north is a solid looking 
wooden door.

Store Room~
You stand in a dark room, surrounded by many boxes and bags of food, and cooking
utensils. There is a smell here, it is similar to that of your grandfather's
tool shed. There is an exit south to the kitchen.

Cellar~
As you slowly climb down you see that you are surrounded by water. The water is
just above your chest level, and you feel quite refreshed as the water is quite
cool. But realising that the water is probably from a pipe leading from the
toilets you start feeling slightly sick. There is more cellar east, and up is
the way back to the storeroom.

Cellar~
As you tread the water with you arms and legs to stay afloat you feel some life
around here, perhaps this is the site where that terrible accident occurred..???
You definitely hope not. The cellar is large and there are rooms to you north, 
east, and west.

Cellar~
This part of the cellar is also filled with water, however towards the north end
of the room the water level drops to your ankles. You can definitely hear a
sound coming from the north. Maybe you don't want to go there? From here you can
swim west or walk north.

Dry Part Of Cellar~
As you walk out of the water you wonder why one part of the cellar should be so
much higher than the others. Surely it is an accident! Some sort of mistake in
the building plans of the old building. Or of course it could be like this 
because a large amphibian lives here, and it needs both land and water to stay 
alive, that would explain the blood stains on the wall! As you look down you see
the tenant of this place. The exits are west and south. Use Them!

Underwater In Cellar~
The roof in this part of the cellar is so low that it is filled to the top with 
water. You cannot Stay underwater for much longer, you'd better get out of here
while you still can. The exits are down, south, and east.

Deep Underwater~
All there is here is well water, but what is that sparkle you see at the bottom
of the room? Is it gold and jewels of immense value, or maybe a creature of the
deep?
The only OBVIOUS exit is up.

Classroom~
This classroom is decorated with graffiti on every wall. The desks are out of
alignment, and the blackboard is covered with rude statements. Considering that
this classroom has not been cleaned yet, it is in quite good shape.
The door is to the south.

Empty Classroom~
You stand in an empty classroom, remembering, with some sadness, the day you
were last in one of these. There are many desks and chairs here. The teacher's
desk is turned upside down. The only way out of here is to the north.

Corridor~
You are walking along a rather wide corridor. On one side you see some lockers,
most with locks on them, some with no locks, others still with no doors at
all. You are glad that these are not your lockers. There is a classroom to the
north, and more corridor to the east and west.

Classroom~
This is an empty classroom. Really empty. No desks, no chairs, no carpet, no
lights, not even a blackboard. What a boring place. You feel bad vibes all 
around you. The door is to the south of here.

Corridor~
This part of the corridor is quite similar to every other bit of the corridor in
this school. The basic brick walls are covered with lockers, posters and chewing
gum. There is also quite a bit of graffiti. There is a classroom to the south, 
and the principal's office is to the east.

This classroom is in bad shape. A lifetime of psychological counselling could 
not even scratch the surface of the deep emotional psychological and physical

been sent down here, for disciplinary and other reasons. How you hated the 
principal. Oh! how you wanted to kill the ^%$&*. You still hate him. You still
want to kill him. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE! The only exit is to the west.

this town would be, and how bad it would be for the town's tourism industry if 
everyone never came here. Then you remember that this place may get better as
you keep going. You can go either of two ways, east or west, ... don't try going
both.

way to find out: go west through the grand gates of Angel Park, or you can go 
back to the south, knowing you have not missed out on anything major.

As soon as you walk through the gates of the park you realise that it isn't 
called Angel Park for nothing. There are statues of angels almost everywhere, 
some standing, some flying, one practicing archery (you think his name is Cupid)
there are even some angels doing things that you would probably be fined for 
doing. (whether you are a famous singer or not).The park stretches to the north 
and south and there is a lake to the west the park gates or to the east.

You begin to feel lost here. Parts of the desert start looking completely 
identical to the other parts. It's all yellow and rocky. You wonder if you will
ever get out of here, if there is a way back, and if there is will you ever find 
it???? You definitely hope you will. You can go east and west.

These wastelands are so boring. You wonder why god created them, then you 
remember that you are a complete atheist and you don't believe in the bible 
story of 7 days of creation, You start pondering about the Big Bang, and the
theory of relativity. When you stop thinking you can go north south or east.

You hit an invisible barrier here and realise that you simply cannot go west or 
south. From that, you deduct, using all your puny brain power that you can go 
north and east.

You think you finally came somewhere. This part of the desert is a bit different
from the rest. To the east lies the boring part of the desert that you were just
lost in. But to the south you see a dark room with electricity pulsing through 
it. You wonder if you should go in.

The Dark Room~
As you step in the electric pulses remove the bonds between first the organs, 
then the cells then the molecules and finally the atoms of your body.

YOU ARE DEAD!

Or at least you would be if your body would not be remade in a completely
different location, a few thousand miles away.

This is a dark corner of the building there is not much here except some plastic
body armour and a helmet. It is not very interesting here, maybe you should go 
and explore a more interesting part of the building. There is a light coming 
from the west and south.

and a robot with a UFO shaped head rushing around talking to himself, trying to 
repair something or other or find someone in some other dimension. ...or
something... You can go north south east or  west.

This room serves no obvious purpose, it is completely empty. There is a light 
streaming down from the ceiling, the light source however is not visible, it is
as if the ceiling itself is glowing. there is another room to the south, or you
can go back to the repair room to the east.

But maybe you shouldn't touch them. The owners of the boxes would not appreciate
it very much.

and there is a vast number of coloured lights above you, making you feel like a
star.
In the middle of the room resides a large ball of energy, beneath it you see a
small plaque.
The exit is to the south.
