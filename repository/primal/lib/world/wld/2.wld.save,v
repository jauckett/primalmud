Primers Palace~
You stand in the home of Primer.  It is a Dark and rather musty
smelling building.  All maner of rare treasures litter the floor
discarded as if of little monetary value.  You see a well oiled
leather whip hung on the wall.  A trusty Zippo lighter sits on a
well carved rock pedestal.
Your obvious exit leads East through what appears to be a cave
opening.  In the middle of town.  How strange!.

House of Deathblade~
As you enter the house the noise from the street fades.
You are walking on a bed of pine needles, through a huge forest.
Mighty pine trees stretch endlessly in all dirctions, illuminated only
by the green-tinged shafts of sunlight that occasionally win past the
canopy above.
Birdsong sometimes rises above the rushing of wind through the trees, and
the rare glimpse of movement between the trunks betrays the presence of
animals in the pine forest.
The pine needles have gathered against the trunk of a truly ancient pine,
making the most comfortable bed you have ever seen.
This looks to be a good place to rest for a while.

Too dark to tell~
You are currently standing in Karma's House.  This is where Karma
spends his nights, when he's not busily building more rooms around the
place, and expanding the universe.  The place is bright, and nicely
decorated. Two strange devices sit in the corner, with words flashing
across them.  You assume Karms uses these to create and destroy.

You are standing at the mouth of a very dark cave. It is damp and
extremely cold here, and you swear you can hear the agonising scream
of a distressed being from deep within the void. You can see what 
looks like human bones scattered all over the dusty floor. You can 
feel the deep stare and can hear the spine-chilling snarl from a 
vicious creature lurking in the shadows. It might be a good idea to 
get out of this horrible place while you still can!

long drapes hung over the double paned window that looks out over the
river, and the countryside outside Haven.

Talisman's Lounge~
Delightful pictures by budding artists hang on the walls of this
enclosed room, varying from wild and impossible beasts to exquisite
scenery of picturesque plains and disturbing images of what could only
be Lhankwood Forest. The furniture in this parlour is obviously intended
for comfort and there is an upright piano nearby for those with an ear
for fine music.

Talisman's Tower~
Rising above Haven this tower is a beacon of light in the darkness that
enroaches upon the land. Studying endlessly the master of this tower
searches for that which will forever bring peace and prosperity to the
troubled peoples of this world. Fascinating tidbits lie strewn around
the sparse tower, evidence of old experiments.

Dreamweaver's Loft~
As you look at your surroundings, you marvel at its size and beauty. "Wood.",
you think to yourself, "So much wood, the likes of which you have never seen
or heard of."  Wonderous furnishings are carefully placed to give a very 
warm and friendly feeling.  The sheer size of this loft is just extraordinary.
You comfortably come to the conclusion that it is just a breathtakingly 
peaceful place.

DMoC's Cellar~
His desk seems to be a mess with lots of papers with scribblings on them.  This
room is bare, just the desk and a painting of the sea on the wall.  There is 
nothing else present in the room.  It seems like a good idea to leave before
you get caught!

Tower~
You are in some kind of wizards tower. Spell components and arcane scripture
are scattered around the room. It looks as though no one has been here in a
very long time.

Map Room~
Before you stands a large table covered in maps of varying sizes and
intricacy. Some maps you easily recognize such as Haven and Rome. 
Others emanate an aura of malevolence, making you feel fortunate you
have never been there.

Aphrodite's Temple~
As you enter into the temple, you notice curtains decorated on every
corner of the room. The curtains are made of soft satins and chiffons. The
room is demurely decorated with soft round pillows, carefully placed
artistically. At the end of the room is a figure of a lady statue
simbolising the owner of this place.
