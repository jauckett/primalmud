The Outer Wall~
You are standing on the outer wall of this deserted city. Looking out to your
north you can see the Great Sandy Desert. Looking To your south-west you see
a large sphinx like structure that sits in the center of the city. The size
of this sandstone monument covers the whole of the large courtyard. It towers
over the wall that you are standing on and appears to reach into the 
clouds above it.

city, yet the desert that surrounds it has now overtaken the city. All
that has been left standing is the large unusual monument in the center
courtyard.

You are walking along the outer wall in this deserted city. Directly to your
east you can see the large iron gate and to your north the desert sands 
stretch for miles. It is obvious that this sandstone wall is eroding at a
rapid rate and you determine this is probably due to the harsh desert winds
and storms. Looking onto the center of the deserted city you see a large 
sandstone sphinx that's top is covered by a mysterious billowing cloud

strongly from the north into the  city scattering sand at your feet and 
making visibility difficult.

appear to be covering the top of it and looming over your head. Although 
these clouds look slightly ominous you still feel a strange tranquility 
presides here.

reach forward you touch the base of its feet. Your head alone only 
touches the very top of its paw and as you look up you see it's face.
Yet beyond the point of it's face you can only see the white billowing 
clouds.

to the ground if well over twenty feet and you would hate to fall.

The section of the sphinx that you are standing in is similar to a small 
alcove and as you take a careful look around you notice that one of the 
teeth, that is made from sandstone, looks slightly loose. You wonder what 
would happen if you actually tried to pull at the sphinx's tooth, maybe 
it would break away in your hands.

On the Sphinx~
You are walking precariously around a very thin path on the sphinx. The 
wind that blows off the sandy desert makes you feel extremely unsafe as
you try and walk around the sphinx. It seems to be that strong that with one
wrong step you could go falling down into the sandstone courtyard bellow 
you. To your east you see the head of the sphinx that looks as if it is 
possibly sheltered from this vicious wind.

You are swimming along a dark watery tunnel underneath the deserted city, 
where the water is a beautiful violet colour.  You are unsure why the 
water is the unusual colour yet it is certainly has a tranquil and calming
effect. As the cool water laps around your body you are glad to be out of 
the fierce ray's of the sun that had been beating down on you in the
sandy desert and within the courtyard of the deserted city.

water has a calm, soothing effect apon you. You can also make out the 
walls in this section of the tunnel and although they appear to be made 
from sandstone they also have a beautiful turquoise colour to them.
This may explain why the water is such an unusual colour.

On the Sphinx~
As you walk around the dangerous, narrow path on the sphinx you notice 
that the wind does not seem as strong on this side. This makes you feel 
safer than you did on the other side of the sphinx. Looking up you can 
nearly touch the white clouds from the height you are at and as you look 
more closely to the clouds you think that they have a strange dense quality
to them.

Watery Tunnel~
You are standing in a deep watery tunnel that runs underneath this 
deserted city. There is no natural light here and you have difficulty
seeing what lies ahead to your north. The water could not be called cold
however, infact it is rather refreshing after the sand and wind that was
beating down on you within the deserted city.

As you swim along the watery tunnel you notice that there is a small hole

water runs down into what is probably an underground stream.
It is rather dark here and you can just make out that the tunnel heads 
east and west toward and opening.

You have reached a small step in the watery tunnel and you notice that

sandstone step and then travels west. As you look around you can just make
out the sandstone walls although you can not see what is making the water 
this strange violet colour. In this section of the tunnel the water is 
rather shallow and you can feel the sandy bottom through your feet.

water has a calm, soothing effect apon you. You can also make out the 
walls in this section of the tunnel and although they appear to be made 
from sandstone they also have a beautiful turquoise colour to them.
There is also a slight bend in the tunnel and you now have to swim either

and slightly decayed.

actually a read diamond and you marvel at the size of it. The golden 
light looks a little dimmer to your east but it still makes the sandstone
walls look as if the have been painted in gold.

You wonder why nobody has pinced these copious amounts of valuable items.
There must be some extremely strange reason why they lie here untouched.
As you look down at the stones scattered at you feet you notice a large
diamond. This is by far the biggest stone you have ever seen and as you take
a close look you think about moving it aside to see what lies beneath it.

On a Silver lined Cloud~
As you fly over the Silver lined cloud you notice a large hole leading 
upwards through the cloud. There is a stronger breeze coming from this
direction and the golden light is a lot brighter up through this hole.
You also sense a good presense, possibly that of a great god, coming from
above, and you wonder who or what it is.

On a Silver lined Cloud~
As you float above a large Silver lined cloud you marvel at the spectacular
view that surrounds you. Millions of large colourful clouds unlike any 
you have ever seen from the ground before, the unusual golden light that 
creates a strange and magical glow to the clouds and the unusual 
creatures that fly around in these clouds with their large wings 
outstretched and covering over twenty feet in width.

On a Silver lined Cloud~
Flying over this large Silver lined cloud you notice how intense the golden
light is in this high section of the clouds. You must be well over three 
hundred feet above sea level here and you are aware of how quiet it is up
here, away from the hustle and bustle of things on the ground. You feel 
like you could be in heaven, because this is certainly a heavenly place. 
Yet you know you are still alive so it couldn't be heaven really. To your 
east and west you see the Silver lined cloud stretching across the length
of the moutain.

directions.  Looking around at the magnificent view you have you also are

and as you look down you can see the top of the large sphinx and the 
sandstone courtyard far below you. Around you fly the large magnificent

realise that you are over three hundred feet above the ground. You decide
not to risk jumping off the cloud as if you missed the mountain you have
an awfully long way to fall. Looking south you see the very end of the

throughout the clouds. There must be something else that had allowed you 
to see all the light while flying through the clouds. Yes, there is a 
strange and powerful god standinging here. He is covered in gold and 
glows with a strange light, that is why you didn't see him when you 
immediately walked into the room. He blends in with the gold surrounding 
the altar. This is the strange light you had seen while flying through the
clouds.
