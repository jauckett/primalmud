The TARDIS control room~
You are standing in a large brightly lit room. There is no way that this
room could fit inside the police box that you entered to get here...
The walls are covered with circles from the floor to the ceiling. There
is a large door to the south, which seems to be the exit.

You see a large door. There doesn't seem to be anyway to open it...
