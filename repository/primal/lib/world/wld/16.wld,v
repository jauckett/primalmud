Path to graveyard.~
You are walking down a pathway that leads towards the graveyard.
Strange eerie sounds come wailing up the path that make your skin crawl
with goosebumps and fear. Venturing ahead may not be wise. As you look
around you see large elm trees on either side of the path and ahead you can
see a large iron gate that rattles in the wind.

that comes from the south. The large elm trees that surround the dirt path
bend and sway in the wind as you walk past. As you look closer the seem 
to be reaching out towards you in a sinister manner that makes you feel
very fearful of what lies behind the gate to your south.

Pebbled path.~
You have reached a turn in the pebbled path. Here the large elms seem to 
crowd in around you and try and grap you by the clothes. If you didn't 
know better you would say they were alive. This cementary has a sinister 
air to it that makes you extremely apprehensive about continuing any 
futher. From here the pebbled path leads east towards the center path and 
south along a white picket fence.

Rocky path~
You are travelling along a rocky path that leads away from the cemetary and 
into the wild dangerous mountains. Here the elm trees and fir trees are 
extremely dense and you find it difficult to see through them. You can 
still here the horrible wailing wind that surrounded you in the cemetary 
from here. Large footprints occasionally appear as you climb upwards. You 
should be feeling cooler as you climb up, but quite the opposite happens. 
You can feel it getting distinctly warmer.

Rocky path~
You are travelling along a rocky path that leads away from the cemetary and 
into the wild dangerous mountains. Here the path turns around the dense 
foliage and heads to your south. You can not see very far ahead or around
you because the trees are so thick here. On the ground at your feet small
flowers begin to wilt and die, an overwhelming feeling of evil comes over 
you.

Rocky path~
You are travelling along a rocky path that leads away from the cemetary and 
into the wild dangerous mountains. Here the path turns around the dense 
foliage and heads to your north and west. You can not see very far ahead or 
around you because the trees are so thick here. On the ground at your 
feet small flowers once pretty and colourful are becoming brown and 
withered, even some of the trees are looking wilted.

You are travelling along a rocky path that leads away from the cemetary and 
into the wild dangerous wilderness. Still climbing, the air around you 
becomes warmer and more humid, you find your self panting, not at the 
lack of air, but at the quality of it.

You are travelling along a rocky path that leads away from the cemetary and 
into the wild dangerous mountians. Here the elm trees and fir trees are 
extremely dense and you find it difficult to see through them. You can 
still turn back... there is definatly something wrong here.

Rocky path~
As you wander along the rocky path that is surrounded by huge fir and elm
trees that are so dense you can barely see the path ahead, you wonder where
this path is taking you. Many leaves are falling from the trees, the 
small shrubs that were growing no longer do. You know that Havens cemetary 
is to your north but you can no longer hear the horrible sounds that come 
from there.

Rocky path~
You are travelling along a rocky path that leads away from the cemetary 
and into the wild dangerous wilderness. From up ahead in the mountains you 
hear several really really really scarey noises. Looking out through the trees 
occasionally you can catch a glimpse of the Graveyard far below you.

but you can no longer hear the horrible sounds that come from there.
Still climbing steadily, you can feel the warm ground under your feet, 
many of the trees are dying and look very sick.

Large patches of dead fir and elm trees lie everywhere, not all the trees 
have died from the toxins in the air, many have just been snapped at the 
base, pushed over and branches stripped. The ground is quite hot and the 
air almost unbreathable.

Only burnt stumps of trees lie around you, you can't see anything green 
except for perhaps the trees beneath you. You can get a clear view of the 
structure on top of the mountain now. Unfortunatly if thats your 
destination you have some serious climbing to do to get there...

The last uphill pinch is ahead of you, from there the mountain flattens  
out. There are hardly any trees or any stumps left here. Most have been  
carted away for something or another. The black cloud you could see from  
the ground is hovering about you. No wonder trees cant live here.

At last you up the mountain, the structure you could see before is
much more clear now... the black haze is thinner as you get closer and you 
can see its actually a fortress, a huge black castle surrounded by black soil 
and lots of nothing... except for all those wierd creatures just waiting  
to pay you a visit.
