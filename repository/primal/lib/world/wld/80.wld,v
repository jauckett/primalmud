Outside the Wayhouse~
   You are outside a large, two-story building which proports
to be 'Werith's Wayhouse' on a brightly lettered sign out 
front.  You hear laughing and revelry from inside -- sounds 
like a lively place.  The main doors are directly south of 
you, and small paths lead east and west around the building. 
Eastward is another smaller building; obviously a stable.  
Northward is the main road, providing all the traffic and 
customers for this establishment.

Near a Large Building~
   You are north-west of the Wayhouse.  This section of the 
path seems less used, possibly because there's nothing really
over here.  The trees crowd in towards the clearing, making 
the general area seem rather eerie somehow.  The voices 
coming from inside are clearly audible, and by listening hard
you can almost make out the words.  
   The path around the building continues to the west and 
south.

   You are standing on the path that runs around the Wayhouse
to the west.  A window spills light onto the trees that block
out all available light overhead.  You hear general merryment
and alcoholism from inside, and wonder if being inside would 
be more fun than walking around outside...

Near a Large Building~
   You are south-west of the main structure of the Wayhouse. 
A lone rain barrel catches run-off from the roof eaves by the
corner of the building, and you spy a small white fence 
cordoning off an herb garden nearby.  The path around the 
building leads to the north and east.

Outside the Wayhouse~
   You are standing just south of Werith's Wayhouse, right 
where the kitchen entrance is.  A well trodden path leads 
east, towards a small shack that is unmistakeably an outhouse.
You hear the unmistakeable sound of clanging pots and pans 
from the inside, the warning of an upcoming meal.  The path 
around the building here runs east, and west.

Near a Large Building~
   The Wayhouse is just north-west of you here, and you are 
right by the facility's outhouse to the south.  The wooden 
planks of the stable form an alley to the north, with the 
path leading right in-between.  Westwards is the kitchen 
entrance to the Wayhouse, kept wide open to let the heat 
inside escape.

   This is a small, outdoors 'alley' formed by the Wayhouse's
stone walls to the west, and the wooden planked walls of the 
stable to the east.  The path around the building leads north
and south of here.

Near a Large Building~
   You are on a small, well-travelled path that leads between
Werith's Wayhouse to the west, and the stables to the east.  
Another path breaks off to the south, between the two 
buildings, towards what appears to be an outhouse.

Just Outside the Stable~
   The stable of the Wayhouse is just south of you, its 
wooden doors spread open and inviting.  Inside you can hear 
the snorting of horses, and the occasional hoof scraping 
against the ground.  The path leads to the west, towards the 
Wayhouse.

Inside the Stable~
   You are standing inside the dusty confines of the stable. 
Stalls line the aisle, some with horses, some empty.  A pail 
filled with water and a stack of grain are heaped up against 
the interior wall, dimly illuminated by a lantern hanging 
from a rafter.  Seems rather quiet in here...

Main Room~
   The bar runs south here all along the western wall.   A 
few smaller tables here are set up with various board games, 
ready to play.  There's also a shelf along the wall, lined 
with a few popular books; light reading all of them.  The 
patrons here seem to be a bit quieter than the rowdy bunch 
in the rest of the building.

Main Room~
   A window here offers a view outside, where it doesn't seem
near as social as it is inside.   Tables filled with laughing
customers eat and drink and generally be merry, not caring 
what the weather is like, and probably not even knowing.  
There's a general sense of joy in the room; the joy of still 
being alive in such a dangerous world as this one.  For a 
moment, you feel like joining them...

Main Room~
   You stand just inside the Main Room of Werith's Wayhouse. 
The whole place stretches out all around you, a 
conglomeration of people, food, and alcohol.  The sheer 
chatter and roar of conversation makes your ears hurt a 
little, and then you suddenly notice you're smiling.  Yes, 
this place might do for awhile...

Main Room~
   The giant fireplace here sends a great amount of heat 
throughout the room.  The sheer massiveness of the stone 
edifice and the literal bonfire inside makes you give the 
area a clear way.  A few of the older and less human 
residents of the inn seem to be enjoying these tables, 
however.

Main Room~
   Several dart boards line the wall to the south, and darts 
are scattered all about on the tables and stuck in the wall. 
The people coming up and down the stairs to the east 
carefully walk by the wall to avoid being pin-cushioned 
involuntarily, and you think it would be a good idea to do 
the same.

Main Room~
   The tables seem to thin out around here, to give room for 
the traffic going in and out of the kitchen through the 
archway to the south.  Waiters and waitresses march in and 
out with empty plates and sumptuous platters, hardly stopping
to breathe in their business.  You hear the distant clank of 
a pot banging against something -- the chefs are busy too it 
seems.   Your stomach growls...are you hungry at all?

Main Room~
    This seems to be a central part of the room, where many 
people congregate to talk or sing or dance or whatever they 
feel like at that exact moment.  The people seem just on the 
edge of being completely carried away at every moment, and 
you wonder if it would be beneath your dignity to join them.

   The wooden bar runs along the length of the western wall, 
just in front of the many shelves of different colored 
alcohol in different shaped bottles.  You espy drunkards and 
waitresses, adventurers and farmers althroughout the building
from this vantage point, and guess that this establishment is
turning a pretty penny in profits.  Nice.

   The bar continues along the length of the western wall.  
An empty bottle with some spare coppers in it lies on top of 
its polished surface; tip collection evidently.  The tables 
nearby seem mostly filled with people and food, the bar 
appears at times to be either packed, or merely elbow-to-
elbow.  A lantern hanging from a rafter overhead casts 
shadows among the beerstains on the floor and gives the 
complexion of everyone around a sort of glow.  You feel...
comfortable here.

Main Room~
   In the clutter of the main room of the Wayhouse, is a path
leading out from the kitchen to the east.  A wide archway
allows admittance to the back room, from which you hear the 
distant clank of a pan hitting another.  There aren't very 
many tables here, due to the amount of traffic coming in and 
out.

Kitchen~
   This is the main entranceway of the kitchen.  Two archways
serve as an entry and exit point from the main room of the 
wayhouse, one north, one west.  The kitchen is a room roughly
thirty feet by thirty feet, extending from the south and east
from here.  You see many pots on the stove bubbling away and 
hear the whistle of a kettle somewhere off to the left...
business must be good.

Kitchen~
   You are standing in a more quiet area of the kitchen, 
where various supplies of flour, grain and meats are kept.  
The kitchen extends south and west from here; that's where 
the main clutter seems to be.  A steady thump-thump-thump 
from the north wall reminds you that the main room is where 
are the fun and action seems to be...

Kitchen~
   The south-eastern section of the kitchen here is a 
veritable whirlwind of activity!  The entire area is 
comprised of cooking surfaces and ovens; enough to keep a 
massive amount of food ready at any one time.  The aisles
are large, allowing room for frantic chefs and waiters to 
hurtle through the kitchen with only a small amount of 
collisions.  Seems hectic, yet efficient.  The rest of the 
kitchen is to the north and west from here.

Kitchen~
   This is the back entranceway to the kitchen, where the 
door is kept seasonally open to allow the hot air to escape. 
Some trash is piled up near the door, waiting to be taken 
out.  The main area of the kitchen extends to the north and 
east from here, a hodge-podge of business and insanity in 
motion.  Looking at the general cleanliness, however, you 
think this would be a good place to eat.

Main Room~
   This is a quiet, darkened corner -- it appears someone 
has put out the lantern here on purpose.  You feel a chill, 
probably due to your distance from the fire, and rub your 
arms absently.  There's a table set near the corner, a single
chair behind it in the shadowy of shadows.  You get the 
cliche'd feeling someone in robes should be sitting there.

   The bar runs along the length of the west wall here, 
dispensing drinks to all customers with impunity.  A few 
tables are empty here in the southern part of the wayhouse, 
but the whole place still has that 'mostly filled' air to it.
The dull roar of conversation and the warm air from the fire 
makes you feel at home somehow, makes you want to have a 
seat.

Stairwell~
   Some sturdy wooden stairs lead up to the second floor of 
the wayhouse, where there are a few rooms for rent.  A lonely
lantern lights the way up, glinting off the polished 
handrail.  An arch to the east opens up into the main room...
where the noise informs you that the revelry hasn't stopped 
yet.

The floors, stairs, and walls are all made with sturdy oak 
in contrast of the heavy stone of the exterior walls.  A 
light at the top of the stairs throws illumination down the 
hall.

   Um.  Whew!
   It's definitely an outhouse...doesn't smell too good at 
all.
There's a wooden plank with a few 'convenient' holes cut in
it for service, and several curtains hung up for privacy.  A 
bowl with a large cake of soap next to it serve as sanitary 
measures.  Otherwise, there's not too much here that you take
an interest in...
