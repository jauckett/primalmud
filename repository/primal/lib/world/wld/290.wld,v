Entrance to Perseid Mining Colony Base~
You are standing at the entrance of a large building facility. You 
gasped a moment as you see how enormous this building appears to be. To 
the north is a dark hallway while the south you can see the Tatooine
Desert.

As you enter the building, a sliding door automatically opens to 
welcome you into the facility. To the north is a further stretch of the 
hallway and the south is the entrance to the base.

The hallway is dark and gloomy. Furthermore, it is quiet, too

base. The hallway continues north and south.

The Janitors Room~
What can you say, it's the janitor's room!! What you see are 
cleaning equipment, dirty overalls and what appears to be a left over
of a doughnut; they are pretty useless to you. The only exit is the
way where you came from.

Even though it is part of the hallway, this surroundings seem to 
be different. You can see damages to the walls, ceilings and floors.
Fireburns, wirings hanging from the ceilings and traces of dried
blood on the floor. To the north appears to be a room, to the east is 
another hallway and the south is where you came from.

The Secondary Communications Network Room~
This room acts as a backup for internal and external
communications in case the primary system fails. You see all the
complicated gadgetry and systems but they  fail to attract your attention.
You have a feeling that the system is not running effectively. To
the north is the Sensor Network and Drone Monitoring Room and the 
west is where you came from.

This room monitors, evaluates and stores data from the base's
thousands of sensors. As part of its function, it identifies 
intruders, collates data, pinpoints trouble/system errors and 
breaches as well as locates internal and external damages. Obviously,
the system is not working or else it would have detected you as an
intruder. To the east is the Internal Defence Network Room and to the
