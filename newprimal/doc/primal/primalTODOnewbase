********************************************************************************
Ideas: (on the back-burner)

- quest logging system - make it log the date, type, characters, winner, prizes
  into a file

- eq sizes (blacksmith, tailor for resizing) - might be a pain in the arse I think

( 0%) Immortal System
  - immortal entertainment system

( 0%) Dynamic Global Vars which are saved to file (used filevar types)

( 0%) Rooms
       - Descriptions for night/day - special descriptions
       - Fire - make rooms able to catch fire - make it able to spread, and be put out
       - Flooded - similar to fire ...

( 0%) Explosives
       - Mortal - implement some kind of explosives.
       - Immortal - blow up a zone

- Spell/Skill fortify room (idea by Artus): Once cast (or performed) on a room,
  mobs cannot enter room until the caster moves from the room. A med-high
  level skill and a high level spell. Could extend it to stoping PCs, but this
  will require the addition of a !FORTIFY zone flag. 

  affected stats for spell: int, con, str, wis
  affected stats for skill: con, str, int

  Resistance level could be calculated via the stats given above.

- make mail saveable ...
