   Hi DM

   I died twice yesterday and someone got the wrong corpse for me. Can you perhaps
   recreate some eq for me please? Here's my list:
   1 soul crystal, 1 ppg, 2 cloak of thorns, 2 seeded rings,
   2 motorbike chains, 1 diamond plate, 1 mechanical claw,
   1 unearthly red jewel, 1 gum boots, 1 set of strong biceps
   1 ring of thorns (the shield)
   I don't remember everything I lost, but will get the rest myself anyway.

   Thanks
   Kreep
