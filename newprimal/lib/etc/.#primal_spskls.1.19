&3Level&n: 5
&3Usage&n: &4backstab <victim>&n
&3Class&n: Thief, SpellSword, Priest, NightBlade, Master

Backstab is a way to sneak up on a person and attempt to place your dagger
in their back, at exactly the point where it does most damage.  A successful
backstab gives a damage multiplier, depending on level:

Levels  Multiplier
------  ----------
 1-7        2
 8-13       3
14-20       4
21-30       5

The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well you
have practiced backstab at your guild.  You can always backstab sleeping
people.
