Surrounding you are huge sharks with nashing teeth and mouths that would
swallow you whole. The large fish that also swim around the bottom of the
ocean are incredibly ugly and probably poisonous. However occassionly you 
catch glimpses of beautiful mermaids, creatures that you had thought were
only legends.

Cavern~
A small underwater river streams in gurgling from the north. The water seems 
fresh and clear. The river has carved itself a way around the stalagmites.
It is very noisy here as the walls throw back the echo from the boiling 
water. As you listen to this natural sound you get the impression as if 
there was another sound, a man made sound in the background, but you 
quickly push away this thought as it is only your wish for civilisation.

Ocean floor~
You are swimming in the deepest depths on the bottom of the ocean floor.
Surrounding you are huge sharks with nashing teeth and mouths that would
swallow you whole. The large fish that also swim around the bottom of the
ocean are incredibly ugly and probably poisonous. However occasionally you 
catch glimpses of beautiful mermaids, creatures that you had thought were
only legends.

You stand in a huge cavern so huge in fact,  that your light source cannot

stalagmites and stalactites look grotesque and seem to dance as
you turn your head in order to look around. Here and there you see 
strange symbols carved out of the rock and you wonder who would go so far

As you walk along the golden hall you notice why it is named like this,
the ceiling is made of pure gold with precious carvings telling stories
otherwise long forgotten. If you look closely you see it illustrates the
story of evolution of all being. Now if only you had more time to study it
you would even stand a chance of becoming wise... but then again that's not
the purpose of your visit here, so forget about it and move on.

between boys and girls, with the usual explanations why either boys are 
better than girls or girls are better than boys. What did you expect?
Kids are kids whether they live above or below the water.

Golden hall~
As you walk along the golden hall you notice why it is named like this,
the ceiling is made of pure gold with precious carvings telling stories
otherwise long forgotten. If you look closely you see it illustrates the
story of evolution of all being. Now if only you had more time to study it
you would even stand a chance of becoming wise... but then again that's not
the purpose of your visit here, so forget about it and move on.
The hall continues north and south from here.

coming from the Odeon.

End of narrow corridor~
You are walking along a dull narrow corridor, there are no decorations here
and it's only dimly light by some terrible smelling seaweed torches.
The corridor ends abruptly here, you think of the possibility that this might
once have been a secret passage but if so it's long gone. Time to turn back.

Inside a shipwreck~
The wreck lies here for centuries.
But here and there you can see some of the remains of the ancient glory 
and luxury of this ship, but most of it has gone - washed away by the sea.
On the walls and floor grow now corals and anemones, fish swim in and out
the hatches.

You swim through a thick seaweed forest that seems to go on
for miles. It is difficult to tell which way you should head in
because the density of the seaweed block your view from everything
that may surround you. You are beginning to feel hopelessly lost

are all over the floor - what a mess!
It does seem somebody has been here recently!

rushing thru your veins. A school of barracudas passes by in front of you.

have become. Obviously this shack has been here for quite a long time.
To your east you can see the beautiful white sandy beach that is cluttered
