Welcome to the abode of Stormbringer the kindhearted.  As you peer around the
room you notice that this gentle man lives a modest life and has most comforts
a home requires.  What is rather startling is the little storm cloud hovering

Blossum's bawdy boudoir. ~
As you stand and gaze at the rich tapestries on the wall, your attention is
drawn to a massive king-size four poster bed.  You stand in awe at the superbly
carved mahogany posts.  As you look closer you can see notches on one post, and
wonder what they are indicating!  The curtains are closed and you can hear
laughter coming from behind them.  You realise you are not alone!

   You are in &rhell&n.  As one of the highest gods known to this world, your own
presence can only mean there is work to be done.  Though, it is quite tempting
to laze away in procrastination, surrounded by the lava and fire pits of &rhell&n,
you are all too aware of how much this accomplishes.
