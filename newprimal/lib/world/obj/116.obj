   &yThese items will be in the Food Warmer
&YChips
   &yThese will be in the Chip Machine
&YCoke
   &yThese will be stacked on the ground
   You will need to fill the coke from the Drink machine.

&yIf you get the order ready and hand it to the customer on time the 
customer will put tokens in the register.

&yOnce a week the owner of "Concert Goers Food" will come to collect the 
tokens from the register. When he collects the tokens you will be rewarded 
for your work. This reward will vary depending on how many orders you serve 
in that time.

&YFor this you will need to:
&yCollect the tokens from the register, hand them to him and ask him to
count them.

&YGive Manager Money eg.&n

say count please


&yYou also had better be on the look out for a Robber, who from time to time,
will drop in and steal all the money in the register.

&yAfter you have had time to read through this info
say "Customers Please"
And your working day will begin.
