We, the Kingdom of Golem, beg of you to help us in our hour of need.
As you read this the evil diggings of the Dwarven Mines come closer
and closer to your region.
I beseech you to join with us in forcing the evil Dwarfs to leave these

Please, join with Gorath, my entrusted messenger, and return to our hidden
cave and we together can go forth and destroy.
Yours in humble request,
