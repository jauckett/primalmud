You stand in the home of Primer.  It is a Dark and rather musty
smelling building.  All maner of rare treasures litter the floor
discarded as if of little monetary value.  You see a well oiled
leather whip hung on the wall.  A trusty Zippo lighter sits on a
well carved rock pedestal.
Your obvious exit leads East through what appears to be a cave
opening.  In the middle of town.  How strange!.

House of Deathblade~
As you enter the house the noise from the street fades.
You are walking on a bed of pine needles, through a huge forest.
Mighty pine trees stretch endlessly in all dirctions, illuminated only
by the green-tinged shafts of sunlight that occasionally win past the
canopy above.
Birdsong sometimes rises above the rushing of wind through the trees, and
the rare glimpse of movement between the trunks betrays the presence of
animals in the pine forest.
The pine needles have gathered against the trunk of a truly ancient pine,
making the most comfortable bed you have ever seen.
This looks to be a good place to rest for a while.

You are standing at the mouth of a very dark cave. It is damp and
extremely cold here, and you swear you can hear the agonising scream
of a distressed being from deep within the void. You can see what 
looks like human bones scattered all over the dusty floor. You can 
feel the deep stare and can hear the spine-chilling snarl from a 
vicious creature lurking in the shadows. It might be a good idea to 
get out of this horrible place while you still can!

Stormies's House~
Welcome to the abode of Stormbringer the kindhearted.
As you peer around the room you notice that this gentle man
lives a modest life and has most comforts a home requires.
What is rather startling is the little storm cloud hovering
in the corner of the room waiting for its master to come home.

Talisman's Bedroom~
This darkly decorated room emanates feelings of peace and solitude. No
sounds penetrate the thick walls, leaving the inhabitants in blissful
isolation and quiet. A large four post bed is the centrepiece, shaded
nets keeping night beasts at bay. The only light present is filtered by
long drapes hung over the double paned window that looks out over the
river, and the countryside outside Haven.

Rising above Haven this tower is a beacon of light in the darkness that
enroaches upon the land. Studying endlessly the master of this tower
searches for that which will forever bring peace and prosperity to the
troubled peoples of this world. Fascinating tidbits lie strewn around
the sparse tower, evidence of old experiments.

Orbital's Loft~
As you look at your surroundings, you marvel at its size and beauty. "Wood.",
you think to yourself, "So much wood, the likes of which you have never seen
or heard of."  Wonderous furnishings are carefully placed to give a very 
warm and friendly feeling.  The sheer size of this loft is just extraordinary.
You comfortably come to the conclusion that it is just a breathtakingly 
peaceful place.

The first thing you see as you walk into Artus' Kitchen is that the fire is
burning hot, a large pot roast bubbling above it in a cauldron. (Well, it
smells like a pot roast, anyway..). Pots hang from hooks along the east wall,
a wooden sink sits beside the fireplace, and a large wooden table opposite to 
ensure guests are kept warm through dinner. To the north lies Artus' welcoming 
foyer.

Artus' family room consists of a few wooden park-bench style seats, and a large
open fireplace -- in the middle of the room! -- Yes, she's gone to the trouble
of cutting out the floor to have a central fireplace. You can bet that she has
many a wild night with guys and girls dancing around the fire drinking wines and
ales. One can only imagine... Your only option is to leave west, or sit here all 
day.

Artus' Bedroom is quite spacious, even with the Queen size bed, her writing
desk and wardrobe. Scattered around the floor are discarded objects which she 
has no further use for, though nothing you could use yourself eitherr. You lay 
on the bed just quickly, and find it so soft, you can barely feel it under you. 
It's quite obvious no expense was spared. If necessary, you could return to the
Foyer through the east door.

ladder leading back down to the foyer.

A faint gasp emits from you as you stumble down the rickety stairs to Artus' 
house. The basement is a BONDAGE PARLOR! A bed has handcuffs built into it,
a shackle stands before the southern wall, whips, chains, gags, dildos and all
other kinds of erotic equipment lie strewn about the place. You should probably
return up the staircase, before Artus shows you a new meaning for the word -
friend.

The forbidden room~
Entering this room you feel a warm and fuzzy feeling. Lights coming in
from the windows gives the room a look of comfort. At one end of this room
you can see a bed, with a sheer cloth hovering above it covering the bed.
Suddenly you feel somebody's finger placing a tender touch on your body,
fingering you and instead of jumping away in a fright you linger for more.
The form seems to lure you towards the inviting bed and before you know it
you are there. And before you know it you are making love to someone and
its such a pleasure that you want to just stay put and continue the warm
and tender love making. Keeping your eyes close..... you enjoy every
moment. Just for a brief moment you take a peek and NOBODY's there, but
you can still feel every touch to the very chillness of this person
licking your genitals.. but still you didn't jump away in fright cause
there's no longer fear in your soul but love. You know you are going to
stay there for a very very long time. But somehow........

assisted with a few bottles of liquers and a little fridge. Two stools
are placed by the bar waiting to be sited. The walls are artistically
decorated, making the place welcomed.
