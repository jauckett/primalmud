ALIAS ALIASES

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

> alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overriden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

> alias gbb get bread bag
> alias gac get all corpse
n
Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

> alias gbb


A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

> alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.  For example:

> alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
> killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

> alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

> alias tr tell rasmussen $*
> tr hi there, how are you today?
You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

#
ALIGNMENT

Your alignment is a measure of how good or evil you are.  This is a
number between -1000 and 1000, the greater the number, the more Good you
are.  If you drop below -350, you will be Evil, and will have a Red Aura
to those with Detect Alignment.  If you rise above 350, you will be
Good, and will have a Blue aura.

Some items require you to be either Good, Evil, or Neutral, before you
can use them.
#

ANGEL

Angels are players who should be held in high respect by all players.

They are here to help newbies, hold quests and help with the general
running of Primal Mud. 

*To become an Angel you need to reach the level of champion then you have
to contribute more than simply playing time. If you are interested in
becoming and Angel talk to one of the God's about this.

#
ANSI COLOR

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

> color off
This command disables all color.

> color sparse
> color normal
> color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.

CLASS CLASSES

Classes are not actually used in PrimalMUD.  Instead, your race
determines your general attributes (Strength, Dexterity, etc.), and you
are then free to develop your character however you see fit.  This means
that all skills/spells are available to everyone, and you are free to
practice in any guild hall.
#
CLEAR CLS

Clears the screen on many terminals.
#
CLERIC

Classes are not actually used in PrimalMUD.  Instead, your general
characteristics are determined by your race, and you guide your
characters development from there.  The following is provided as a guide
if you wish to style yourself as a Cleric.

Clerics are characters who worship a god.  They dedicate their lives to
the furthering of that god's cause, and are in return granted certain
powers.  These powers take the form of spells, mainly non-violent such
as cure light wounds and heal, although higher-level Clerics will gain
more offensive spells (eg. Call Lightning).  Clerics as a class do not
carry piercing or slashing weapons, prefering instead the option of
bludgeoning their foe into submission.  A cleric improves their skills
(spells) by "prac"ticing at their temple.

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow. Sharing is regardless of wherther the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"
Dragon  : "group redferne"
Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

"GUARDIANS OF JUSTICE"

Long ago when the tyranny of The Avengers reigned supreme over the land, it was
a dark and evil place. Moe, the leader of The Avengers was a cruel tyrant, 
feared by all the newbies. For when he would become bored, this terrible king 
would take up arms, and lay waste to new players everywhere. Thus he was dubbed
The Butcher. 

There also existed two smaller clans. The Primal Knights, and The Astral 
Wraiths. They both suffered under the curse of Moe, until one day, they could 
bear it no more. Being too small to fight the Avengers individually, they 
united to form a tough but short lived clan called The Astral Knights, but due 
to the lies and deception of Moe, our numbers slowly dwindled into a handful of
loyal members. Not to be discouraged, we took our small army, and passed 
ourselves off as clanless fighters, so The Evil One would not watch us.

Finally the day came. We threw off our masks of clanlessness, and rose once more
as The Guardians of Justice! Since then, we have remained one of the two major 
clans of the mud, and a force to be reckoned with. A while after the clan was 
formed, Raistlin was reincarnated as the god Moridin. He is no longer a clan 
leader, but supports us in spirit, and we pay our respects to him. 

The current leaders of the clan are Dracion, Roj, and Tarn. If you are a 
Guardian, and have been attacked by an opposing clan, these are the people you 
should speak to. Essentially, The Guardians of Justice are the watchdogs of the
mud, and will defend the innocent and helpless against Moe's army of darkness. 
All you need do is call, and a Guardian will help.



                         FOR THE HONOUR OF ODIN


                          FOR THE GLORY OF WAR


                    FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INNOCENT


                      FIGHT TO THE DEATH GUARDIANS!

that player to your guest list if the player is not on the list, or will

a house, and quit from the game while standing in your house, you will be
loaded into your house next time you enter the game.

Guests of your house can be defined using the HOUSE command.  See HOUSE for
more information.

Houses are an alternative to renting.  You can simply enter your house,
drop your items, and type 'quitreally', and everything in your house
will be saved for you to retrieve on your return.
There is currently a 50 object limit which can be stored in your house.
Of course, players must expect to pay a much higher premium for
the convenience of houses;

contact Sandii or Kodiak by mudmail for the purchace  of a house.

members of the Jedi Clan. 

We are a peaceful but forceful and powerful presence within the realms of 
Primalmud. We now carry on the traditions that where set down by the mighty 
who have previously ruled over us and never faulter under the pressure of our 
foes. We are the last front in the line of the resistance and would rather give
our lives than let the evil emporer win us over and convert us to the ways of 
the evil empire that he rules. We stand vigilantly wether as one or as a group 
and defend the clan and it's beleifs at all times. In assistance of fighting 
the emporer and his evil ways we have formed an allegiance with the avengers 
and have agreed to assist them as they have agreed to assist us in a variety 
of conquests that arise from time to time.

Whilst we are a peaceful clan we strongly oppose those who wish to continue 
with their unjustices towards others and will assist any person in need of it 
and punish those who stand in the way of our goals.

LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will not be
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.

SHOP SHOPS STORE

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the 
perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of
high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

can be done at the Master Trainer who is located at the Paladin Temple in the

Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at. For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter

you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.

Mobiles and objects currently can not be strung.

THIEF

Classes do not exist as such in PrimalMUD.  Instead, your race
determines you general characteristics, and you are free to guide your
character as you wish.  The following, therefore, is intended as a guide
if you wish to use the thief as a model.

Thieves are characters who have decided to rely more on their natural
wits than on study or faith.  Although not always evil or bad, they do
not tend to have the same sort of respect for authority that other
characters may have.  Their primary skills are their ability to sneak
around, hide from others, and generally be devious.  Their Guildhall is
suitably hidden, but when located they can "prac"tice their skills
there.  A thief is a very handy character to have on your side, but a
potential nightmare as an opponent...

TIME MOON

Classes are not actually used in PrimalMUD.  Instead, your race
determines your general traits, and you are free to develop your
character as you wish.  The following is provided as a guide for those
who wish to style themselves Fighters.

The Warrior is physically the most impressive of the character types.
They are dedicated to the art of battle, and spend most of their lives
perfecting and honing their fighting skills.  They spurn magic,
preferring the comfort of cold steel to the vagaries of forces beyond
their understanding, or the whims of gods.  Likewise, they usually
prefer a straight-up fight to the sneaking and backstabbing methods of
the Thief.
The Warrior 'prac'tices their skills at their guild, under the tutelage
of a past master of swordplay.

RACE
  
The race system used in PrimalMUD allows for a wider range of character
statistics than that of the 4 'class' system used earlier. The races that
a character can be are:
 
       RACE       STR CON DEX INT WIS CHA
[ 1]  Ogre         3   3  -2  -2  -3  -3
[ 2]  Deva        -3  -3   1   3   3   1
[ 3]  Haruchai     1   1   3  -1  -1   0
[ 4]  Elf         -1  -2   3   2   1   3
[ 5]  Changling   -1  -3   1   3   1   1
[ 6]  Human        0   0   0   0   0   0
[ 7]  Orc          3   3   0  -3  -2  -2
[ 8]  Kobold       3   1  -2  -3  -1  -3
[ 9]  Dwarf        4   3  -2  -2  -2  -3
[10]  Gnome        2   3   1  -2  -3  -2
[11]  Kenda       -1   0   3   0  -1   2
[12]  Pixie        0  -1   3   0  -1   2

Type 'help <race>' for help on any specific race, ie:

> help changling

In addition to these race statistic modifiers, a player can select what order
their statistics are assigned dice rolls. The primary statistics are based on 
3d6 rolls which approximate a  standard bell curve, representing the 
ditribution within a population.

METHOD:
  1. The player chooses two stats and take best 3 of 8d6, re-rolling 1's
  2. The player choooses two remaining stats and take best of 4d6, re-roll 1's
  3. Roll 3d6 for remaining stats, re-roll 1's
  4. Higher rolls in [2] or [3] take precedence over lower rolls in [1] or [2]
  
To make this selection, there are 4 presets for statistic order, plus an option
  to select them manually. These options are:

  CLASS                 ORDER
  Cleric        WIS,INT,STR,DEX,CON,CHA
  Thief         DEX,STR,CON,INT,WIS,CHA
  Magic User    INT,WIS,DEX,STR,CON,CHA
